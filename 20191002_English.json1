{"id": 101, "text": "North Korea attacked President Donald Trump's claims of progress in denuclearization talks Monday at the United Nations, saying there has been little so far and that the situation remains trapped in a cycle of tension. More than a year after Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a joint statement in Singapore, US-North Korea relations \"have made little progress so far and the situation of the Korean Peninsula has not come out of the vicious cycle of increased tension,\" North Korea's representative to the United Nations told the General Assembly on Monday morning.   Kim Song, chair of North Korea's delegation, told the UN that this was \"entirely attributable to the political and military provocations perpetrated by the US resorting to the anachronistic hostile policy against the\" Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The North Korean statement stands as a direct rebuttal to Trump's repeated insistence that his decision to embrace the repressive dictator has produced progress toward the goal of ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons.   'Hasten the crisis' The statement comes on a day when the President's former national security adviser, John Bolton, publicly aired his disagreement with Trump's North Korea strategy, telling an audience at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, that he doesn't believe North Korea will ever surrender its nuclear weapons.  Bolton also dismissed Trump's argument about the lack of nuclear and long-range missile testing, saying North Korea no longer needs to test them, as it already has the technology in place. In June, Trump said Kim Jong Un has \"kept his word\" when it comes to nuclear and missile testing -- a direct contradiction of Bolton, who just hours earlier had accused Pyongyang of failing to follow through on its commitments. On Monday, Kim Song told the UN that \"it depends on the US whether the DPRK-US negotiations will become a window of opportunity or an occasion that will hasten the crisis.\"  The North Korea representative also said the full implementation of the joint statement signed by Trump and Kim Jong Un in June 2018 is \"the key to consolidating peace and stability and achieving development on the Korean Peninsula.\" Immediately after that summit, Trump announced that the US would stop \"provocative\" joint military exercises with South Korea. Those have since resumed in a limited fashion.  'Big-power politics' Kim Song said Monday that \"the introduction of the latest offensive weapons and the US-South Korea joint military exercises targeting the DPRK constitute flagrant violation and challenge to the agreement in military field on completely halting hostile acts against the other side and refraining from building up armed forces for implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration.\"  That joint agreement, made in April 2018 by North and South Korea, said the two sides would \"make active efforts to seek the support and cooperation of the international community for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"  The declaration is now at a \"standstill without even advancing into the main phase of implementation,\" Kim Song said, citing South Korea's participation in joint military exercises with the US. Relations between North Korea and South Korea can be achieved only when Seoul ends \"big-power worship and the policy of dependence on foreign forces encroaching upon the common interests of the nation,\" he said.  He attributed the breakdown to \"the double-dealing behavior of the South Korean authorities who performed the act of 'handshake of peace' before the world people, but behind the scene introduce ultra-modern offensive weapons and hold joint military exercises with the U.S. targeting the DPRK.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 11, "Organization"], [31, 43, "Person"], [91, 98, "Time"], [101, 119, "Organization"], [242, 247, "Person"], [252, 264, "Location"], [272, 283, "Person"], [312, 321, "Location"], [323, 325, "Organization"], [326, 337, "Organization"], [403, 423, "Location"], [485, 496, "Organization"], [517, 535, "Organization"], [541, 562, "Organization"], [565, 579, "Time"], [583, 591, "Person"], [602, 613, "Organization"], [633, 639, "Organization"], [735, 741, "Organization"], [801, 838, "Organization"], [841, 857, "Organization"], [899, 904, "Person"], [1029, 1040, "Organization"], [1167, 1178, "Person"], [1217, 1222, "Person"], [1225, 1236, "Organization"], [1270, 1320, "Organization"], [1338, 1348, "Location"], [1374, 1385, "Organization"], [1428, 1434, "Person"], [1450, 1455, "Person"], [1532, 1543, "Organization"], [1617, 1624, "Time"], [1626, 1631, "Person"], [1637, 1648, "Person"], [1743, 1749, "Person"], [1786, 1795, "Organization"], [1845, 1854, "Time"], [1856, 1864, "Person"], [1870, 1877, "Organization"], [1897, 1903, "Organization"], [1916, 1920, "Organization"], [1921, 1923, "Organization"], [2023, 2034, "Organization"], [2117, 2122, "Person"], [2127, 2138, "Person"], [2139, 2151, "Time"], [2230, 2250, "Location"], [2284, 2289, "Person"], [2305, 2311, "Organization"], [2367, 2378, "Organization"], [2449, 2457, "Person"], [2463, 2469, "Time"], [2533, 2535, "Organization"], [2536, 2547, "Organization"], [2583, 2591, "Organization"], [2800, 2809, "Location"], [2852, 2865, "Time"], [2869, 2890, "Organization"], [3033, 3053, "Location"], [3160, 3168, "Person"], [3182, 3193, "Organization"], [3243, 3249, "Organization"], [3269, 3280, "Organization"], [3285, 3296, "Organization"], [3531, 3543, "Organization"], [3728, 3736, "Organization"], [3747, 3755, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 102, "text": "Ousted national security adviser John Bolton made clear Monday his sharp disagreements with his former boss, President Donald Trump, on North Korea, saying he didn't believe Pyongyang would willingly surrender its nuclear weapons. In his first public remarks since being fired by tweet three weeks ago, Bolton said dictator Kim Jong Un -- whom Trump has cultivated as a friend in an attempt at convincing him to surrender his nuclear program -- will \"do whatever he can\" to keep a nuclear weapons capability. \"Under current circumstances he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily,\" Bolton said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. It was a stark break from Trump's stated goal in his talks with Kim, which he says are proceeding well, despite little indication from the North it is willing to abandon its nuclear weapons. Trump has cited a lack of nuclear and long-range missile tests as evidence his strategy is working. But Bolton dismissed that view, saying the reason the North has stopped those tests is the technology is already in place.  In June, Trump said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has \"kept his word\" when it comes to nuclear and missile testing -- a direct contradiction of Bolton, who just hours earlier had accused Pyongyang of failing to follow through on its commitments. Bolton, who left the administration isolated among Trump's other advisers, acknowledged at the start of his remarks he was speaking as a private individual. \"I am delighted to be here today. I'm also sure the leadership of North Korea is delighted I am here today in a private capacity, at least that's what I've read,\" he said. \"Perhaps they'll be a little less delighted now that I can speak in unvarnished terms about the grave and growing threat that the north Korean nuclear weapons program poses to international peace and security.\" He took few steps to disguise his disagreements with Trump. He even again raised the so-called \"Libya model\" for denuclearization, a reference that enraged Trump when Bolton first mentioned it last year since it seemed to temporarily derail his diplomatic efforts with Kim. Describing the current situation with North Korea as a \"classic standoff,\" Bolton said the country's leaders \"want a piece of something that we should not be prepared to give them.\" Earlier this month, Bolton offered scathing criticism of Trump's approach to Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan at a private event hosted by the Gatestone Institute in New York.  \"Bolton didn't have anything positive to say about Trump,\" one attendee said. While Bolton did not mention Trump by name, he said the idea of inviting the Taliban to Camp David was \"disrespectful\" to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to the attendee. As CNN previously reported, Bolton and Trump got into a heated argument over the President's plan to host the Taliban leaders in the days before the 18th anniversary of the attacks, and Bolton did not back down, two people familiar with what happened said. One senior official confirmed this argument happened in the Oval Office and at the end of the meeting, the President asked Bolton for his resignation.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[33, 44, "Person"], [56, 62, "Time"], [119, 131, "Person"], [136, 147, "Location"], [174, 183, "Organization"], [286, 301, "Time"], [303, 309, "Person"], [324, 335, "Person"], [344, 349, "Person"], [594, 600, "Person"], [620, 670, "Organization"], [688, 698, "Organization"], [726, 731, "Person"], [764, 767, "Person"], [835, 844, "Organization"], [891, 896, "Person"], [995, 1001, "Person"], [1041, 1050, "Organization"], [1115, 1122, "Time"], [1124, 1129, "Person"], [1135, 1147, "Organization"], [1155, 1166, "Person"], [1261, 1267, "Person"], [1304, 1313, "Organization"], [1363, 1369, "Person"], [1414, 1419, "Person"], [1547, 1552, "Time"], [1586, 1597, "Organization"], [1822, 1834, "Organization"], [1956, 1961, "Person"], [1999, 2004, "Location"], [2059, 2064, "Person"], [2070, 2076, "Person"], [2172, 2175, "Person"], [2215, 2226, "Organization"], [2252, 2258, "Person"], [2359, 2377, "Time"], [2379, 2385, "Person"], [2416, 2421, "Person"], [2436, 2440, "Organization"], [2442, 2453, "Organization"], [2458, 2469, "Organization"], [2499, 2522, "Organization"], [2526, 2534, "Location"], [2538, 2544, "Person"], [2588, 2593, "Person"], [2621, 2627, "Person"], [2644, 2649, "Person"], [2692, 2699, "Organization"], [2703, 2713, "Location"], [2752, 2774, "Time"], [2825, 2828, "Organization"], [2850, 2856, "Person"], [2861, 2866, "Person"], [2932, 2939, "Organization"], [2948, 3002, "Time"], [3008, 3014, "Person"], [3135, 3150, "Location"], [3202, 3208, "Person"]]}
{"id": 103, "text": "President Donald Trump brandished a closed fist and extended an olive branch to Iran in remarks at the United Nations Tuesday, threatening more sanctions even as he signaled his willingness to talk.  The comments, part of the President's address to world leaders at the UN's General Assembly, were part of a series of mixed messages on Iran, as French President Emmanuel Macron and other American allies pushed hard for the Trump administration and Iran to engage in dialogue. \"No responsible government should subsidize Iran's blood lust,\" Trump said during his speech to the General Assembly. \"As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened.\" But he also noted that that many of America's \"greatest friends\" used to be enemies. \"The United States has never believed in permanent enemies,\" Trump told the audience.  Later in the day, Trump told reporters that Iran \"would like to negotiate. We haven't really worked that out. They're here. We're here ... it certainly makes sense, but we haven't agreed to that yet.\" 'They're here, we're here' Trump's hints about potential US-Iran talks and the possibility that Persian Gulf tensions could be diffused were overshadowed by the day's dominating domestic news that the House of Representatives will launch an impeachment inquiry.  \"Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,\" Trump tweeted. \"So bad for our Country!\" Signs of movement on Iran were visible Monday, when Iran had signaled a willingness to talk and key European allies issued a statement ascribing some responsibility to Iran for the attacks on a Saudi oil facility -- a step US officials had urged.  Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed the attack and Iran has denied it played any role, but Trump administration officials have insisted that Tehran bears sole responsibility.  On Tuesday, Trump had told reporters that Iran \"would like to negotiate. We haven't really worked that out. They're here. We're here, but we have not agreed to that yet. They would like to negotiate. And it certainly makes sense.\"   Trump's inclination for negotiations and deal making could pose pitfalls when it comes to Iran, said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who warned of the \"yap trap of diplomacy.\" \"There's clearly a desire on the part of the President to sit down with Rouhani,\" he said, referring to the Iranian president.  \"It wouldn't surprise me if the Iranians try to get a last-minute negotiation,\" Dubowitz said, drawing a comparison to the situation with North Korea. \"They could pull a Kim Jong Un on him, use the diplomacy to undermine the sanctions on the assumption that Trump is unlikely to escalate further if he's talking to Iran.\"  When reporters asked Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif earlier in the day if President Hassan Rouhani would meet with Trump on the sidelines of the meeting, the foreign minister shouted, \"No!\"  But the day before, Zarif had raised the prospect of a new agreement that would see permanent sanctions relief in exchange for Tehran's permanent denuclearization in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.  Behind the scenes, US allies have been working hard to push for some sort of dialogue. Trump acknowledged this, saying that Macron had been speaking to the US about an Iran meeting, as well as Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  'We have the time' \"She's very much involved. We have a lot of people involved. A lot of people would like to get us to the table,\" Trump said. He added that there's \"a chance\" that Khan could mediate between the US and Iran. Khan \"actually asked me, he thought it would be a good idea to meet and we're here, we're in New York together and we have the time to do it,\" Trump said.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Rouhani for an hour Tuesday, part of an effort to \"achieve de-escalation and stabilization of the situation in the region as well,\" said Masato Otaka, press secretary for Japan's ministry of foreign affairs. Iranian state media said Rouhani had also held talks with Khan and Macron on Tuesday, and was set to meet with Merkel later in the day. The Iranian leader also met with the UK's Boris Johnson.  Trump wasn't the only one under pressure to enter diplomatic talks.  In a meeting with Johnson and Rouhani, Macron said it would be a \"lost opportunity\" if the Iranian leader left the US without meeting with Trump.  'A lost opportunity' If Rouhani \"leaves the country, without meeting with President Trump, honestly this is a lost opportunity,\" Macron said to Johnson, while standing next to the Iranian president. \"Because he will not come back in a few months ... and President Trump will not go to Tehran.\" Johnson agreed with Macron, telling Rouhani, \"you need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time.\" The most forceful push for talks came from Macron, who used his General Assembly address to call for talks and gently criticize the Trump administration's withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  When the US pulled out, Macron said he predicted that the decision \"could only lead to an increase in tensions in the region unless there was a clear prospect for a diplomatic solution ... Well, what do we have today?\" he asked.  \"Iran has responded with a strategy of maximum pressure on its region and environment,\" in response to the US strategy of maximum economic pressure, Macron said. \"The growth in tensions we've seen over the past few months have been constant ... Today, we have a risk of a serious conflict based on a miscalculation or a disproportionate response. Peace is at the mercy of a miscalculation ... and the consequence for the region would be very serious.\" \"More than ever, I very sincerely and profoundly believe that the time has come to resume negotiations between the US, Iran, signatories of the JCPOA, and the countries of the region that are first and foremost affected by the security and stability,\" Macron said.  The goals should be to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, to find a solution to the ongoing war in Yemen, to create a regional security plan that addresses \"other crises in the region\" and maritime security, as well as \"a lifting of economic sanctions,\" Macron said.  Rouhani, speaking on Tuesday to a group of American media managers, said Macron's efforts will only be effective if the US lifts the unilateral sanctions it imposed on Iran after leaving the nuclear pact. Those penalties now cover all essential pillars of the economy, including its central bank and sovereign wealth fund. \"It is only at that time that the negotiations within the Group 5+1 will be possible,\" Rouhani said, referring to the group that negotiated the nuclear deal.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[10, 22, "Person"], [80, 84, "Organization"], [99, 117, "Organization"], [118, 125, "Time"], [266, 291, "Organization"], [336, 340, "Organization"], [345, 351, "Organization"], [362, 377, "Person"], [388, 396, "Organization"], [424, 429, "Person"], [449, 453, "Organization"], [521, 525, "Location"], [541, 546, "Person"], [572, 593, "Organization"], [607, 611, "Organization"], [734, 741, "Organization"], [784, 801, "Organization"], [844, 849, "Person"], [870, 886, "Time"], [888, 893, "Person"], [914, 918, "Organization"], [1098, 1103, "Person"], [1128, 1130, "Organization"], [1131, 1135, "Organization"], [1167, 1179, "Location"], [1268, 1296, "Organization"], [1360, 1378, "Organization"], [1418, 1431, "Organization"], [1513, 1518, "Person"], [1575, 1579, "Location"], [1593, 1599, "Time"], [1606, 1610, "Organization"], [1654, 1662, "Organization"], [1722, 1726, "Organization"], [1748, 1753, "Location"], [1777, 1779, "Organization"], [1802, 1808, "Organization"], [1819, 1824, "Location"], [1853, 1857, "Organization"], [1893, 1898, "Person"], [1943, 1949, "Organization"], [1978, 1988, "Time"], [1990, 1995, "Person"], [2020, 2024, "Organization"], [2211, 2216, "Person"], [2312, 2325, "Person"], [2346, 2387, "Organization"], [2504, 2511, "Person"], [2540, 2547, "Organization"], [2640, 2648, "Person"], [2698, 2709, "Organization"], [2730, 2741, "Person"], [2818, 2823, "Person"], [2875, 2879, "Organization"], [2904, 2911, "Organization"], [2929, 2940, "Person"], [2941, 2959, "Time"], [2973, 2987, "Person"], [3004, 3009, "Person"], [3100, 3105, "Person"], [3207, 3213, "Location"], [3264, 3267, "Organization"], [3270, 3290, "Person"], [3311, 3313, "Organization"], [3379, 3384, "Person"], [3416, 3422, "Person"], [3444, 3450, "Organization"], [3460, 3464, "Organization"], [3485, 3494, "Organization"], [3510, 3520, "Person"], [3525, 3531, "Organization"], [3543, 3556, "Person"], [3691, 3696, "Person"], [3741, 3745, "Person"], [3768, 3774, "Organization"], [3779, 3783, "Organization"], [3785, 3790, "Person"], [3878, 3886, "Location"], [3928, 3933, "Person"], [3941, 3949, "Organization"], [3965, 3975, "Person"], [3985, 3992, "Person"], [4005, 4012, "Time"], [4122, 4134, "Person"], [4156, 4191, "Organization"], [4193, 4200, "Location"], [4218, 4225, "Person"], [4251, 4255, "Person"], [4260, 4266, "Person"], [4267, 4277, "Time"], [4304, 4310, "Person"], [4333, 4340, "Organization"], [4362, 4368, "Organization"], [4371, 4384, "Person"], [4387, 4392, "Person"], [4474, 4481, "Person"], [4486, 4493, "Person"], [4495, 4501, "Person"], [4547, 4554, "Organization"], [4567, 4573, "Organization"], [4595, 4600, "Person"], [4627, 4634, "Person"], [4687, 4692, "Person"], [4732, 4738, "Person"], [4747, 4754, "Person"], [4783, 4790, "Organization"], [4867, 4872, "Person"], [4888, 4894, "Location"], [4897, 4904, "Person"], [4917, 4923, "Person"], [4933, 4940, "Person"], [5062, 5068, "Person"], [5151, 5156, "Person"], [5194, 5198, "Time"], [5282, 5288, "Organization"], [5301, 5307, "Person"], [5488, 5493, "Person"], [5508, 5512, "Organization"], [5610, 5616, "Person"], [5656, 5662, "Person"], [5752, 5757, "Time"], [6070, 6076, "Organization"], [6078, 6082, "Organization"], [6211, 6217, "Person"], [6255, 6259, "Organization"], [6334, 6339, "Location"], [6489, 6495, "Person"], [6503, 6510, "Person"], [6521, 6531, "Time"], [6546, 6554, "Location"], [6576, 6584, "Person"], [6619, 6625, "Organization"], [6671, 6675, "Location"], [6880, 6893, "Organization"], [6913, 6920, "Person"]]}
{"id": 104, "text": "Sen. Kamala Harris on Monday evening issued her most forceful call to date for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, an escalation sparked by the news that Trump allegedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son. But she did not attempt to shield Biden or members of his family from scrutiny as she competes with the former vice president to win the Democratic presidential nomination, though she initially sought to turn attention to Trump's conduct. When asked whether she believed either Biden or his son, Hunter, should be investigated for possible abuse of power, she initially deflected the question by saying, \"Donald Trump is trying to play politics on this issue.\" \"He (Trump) is trying to collaborate with -- and conspired with a foreign leader to interfere in our democracy,\" the California senator said during a visit to Oaxacan restaurant in Los Angeles' Koreatown. \"I have absolutely no support for that. And I believe that that this is a political tactic being waged by Donald Trump, because he obviously perceives a threat. That is a political threat, and I have no support for it whatsoever.\" There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. But when asked whether she shared the concerns of other Democrats that Biden has too much baggage to be the Democratic nominee for the White House, Harris said, \"I'll leave that to the voters to decide.\" \"In my experience, the voters are paying attention to this race, they are paying attention to the issues and people's records,\" Harris said. Still, Harris tried to keep her focus on the current occupant of the White House and her belief that impeachment proceedings should begin now. After visiting with the young second-generation immigrant owners of Guelaguetza, known for its mole and tamales, she pulled out a list of reasons to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump -- \"just to make sure I didn't leave anything out.\" \"I strongly believe that it is long past due that we begin impeachment proceedings against this President,\" Harris said. \"He's pressured a foreign leader, the Ukraine President, to dig up dirt on a political opponent, in the 2020 presidential election. He urged a foreign country to attack our democracy in the 2016 presidential election. He gave classified information to Russian officials in May of 2017.\" On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's President at a time when the country was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States, but he denied doing anything improper. \"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\" Trump said.  On Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed Harris' comments on impeachment, telling CNN, \"Another day, another Democrat shouting the word 'impeachment' to anyone who will listen. Nothing new here. \" Harris added that Trump \"undercut the American intelligence community\" in its efforts to deal with North Korea and the American student, Otto F. Warmbier, who was tortured and killed. On her list, she also referenced the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and journalist who wrote for the Washington Post, stating that Trump \"prefers to take the word of Saudi Prince over the word of the American intelligence community\" while adding he also prefers \"taking the word of the Russian President over the word of the American intelligence community when it came to the interference in the 2016 election.\" \"He had a national security adviser who secretly worked as a foreign lobbyist and, of course, that was Flynn,\" Harris continued referring to Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser. \"He consistently props up murderous dictators, and again that would be Kim Jong Un, it would be the President of Russia. He has obstructed justice in the investigation into his presidential campaign. And we know that because the Mueller report tells us so -- and gives us 10 examples of just that. He has violated federal law by directing his lawyer to pay $280,000 in hush money to cover up two apparent extramarital affairs -- of course that's the Stormy Daniels case.\" Trump has denied having affairs with Daniels and Karen McDougal. She wrapped up the litany of what she views as impeachable offenses by Trump by stating that the President believes he is \"above the law,\" beyond reproach, \"beyond accountability and consequences.\" \"It is time that Donald Trump be held accountable for his behaviors that have been essentially against the best interest of the American people and against the best interest of America's democracy,\" she said. She added that she believes that the transcripts between Trump and the Ukrainian President should be released to Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also weighed in on the controversy on Monday, telling an audience in Dubuque, Iowa, \"We can't go on like this.\"  \"We can't have a President admit on national television to trying to involve a foreign government in impacting the American election and accept that as normal,\" he said.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[5, 18, "Person"], [19, 28, "Time"], [79, 107, "Organization"], [159, 171, "Person"], [212, 217, "Person"], [242, 251, "Organization"], [277, 286, "Person"], [334, 339, "Person"], [437, 447, "Organization"], [522, 527, "Person"], [578, 583, "Person"], [596, 602, "Person"], [705, 717, "Person"], [766, 771, "Person"], [878, 888, "Organization"], [920, 927, "Location"], [943, 953, "Location"], [1072, 1084, "Person"], [1242, 1245, "Person"], [1249, 1261, "Person"], [1334, 1339, "Person"], [1371, 1381, "Organization"], [1394, 1409, "Organization"], [1411, 1417, "Person"], [1595, 1601, "Person"], [1615, 1621, "Person"], [1673, 1688, "Organization"], [1938, 1943, "Person"], [2104, 2110, "Person"], [2155, 2162, "Organization"], [2369, 2376, "Organization"], [2387, 2401, "Time"], [2221, 2225, "Time"], [2307, 2311, "Time"], [2404, 2413, "Time"], [2415, 2418, "Organization"], [2428, 2433, "Person"], [2442, 2451, "Organization"], [2462, 2480, "Person"], [2481, 2493, "Time"], [2514, 2519, "Person"], [2527, 2533, "Person"], [2743, 2746, "Organization"], [2748, 2753, "Person"], [2754, 2763, "Time"], [2796, 2801, "Person"], [2807, 2814, "Organization"], [2908, 2925, "Organization"], [3129, 3134, "Person"], [3185, 3196, "Organization"], [3199, 3204, "Person"], [3212, 3221, "Time"], [3223, 3234, "Organization"], [3251, 3268, "Person"], [3279, 3285, "Person"], [3320, 3323, "Organization"], [3435, 3441, "Person"], [3453, 3458, "Person"], [3469, 3504, "Organization"], [3534, 3545, "Organization"], [3572, 3588, "Person"], [3673, 3688, "Person"], [3694, 3699, "Location"], [3739, 3758, "Organization"], [3773, 3778, "Person"], [3808, 3813, "Location"], [3838, 3873, "Organization"], [3928, 3935, "Organization"], [3963, 3998, "Organization"], [4039, 4043, "Time"], [4158, 4163, "Person"], [4166, 4172, "Person"], [4196, 4209, "Person"], [4211, 4216, "Person"], [4323, 4334, "Person"], [4365, 4371, "Organization"], [4481, 4488, "Person"], [4702, 4716, "Person"], [4724, 4729, "Person"], [4761, 4768, "Person"], [4773, 4787, "Person"], [4860, 4865, "Person"], [5004, 5016, "Person"], [5115, 5123, "Location"], [5164, 5171, "Location"], [5253, 5258, "Person"], [5267, 5276, "Organization"], [5319, 5329, "Location"], [5331, 5338, "Location"], [5346, 5360, "Person"], [5396, 5405, "Time"], [5430, 5437, "Location"], [5439, 5443, "Location"]]}
{"id": 105, "text": "Washington's newest scandal, over a whistleblower's complaint about President Donald Trump, intensified Thursday amid revelations that the White House and Justice Department tried to keep it quiet. The affair, centering on Trump's contacts with a leader of a mystery foreign nation -- identified in two reports as Ukraine -- has also injected a toxic element into relations among the President, the intelligence community and Congress. It is hard to see how any of this ends well. Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out. Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts. The details of the controversy unleashed when a whistleblower sounded the alarm about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public. The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the contacts at issue between Trump and the foreign leader involve Ukraine. In the past, some of Trump's supporters, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have urged the Kiev government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. In a heated exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday night, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice president, before admitting he had done just that. The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.  \"The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,\" Giuliani said.  Trump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as \"highly partisan\" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to \"a certain foreign leader\" were \"pitch perfect.\" Trump tweeted: \"Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!\" Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.  But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Disturbing possibilities There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader. His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. \"Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?\" Trump tweeted on Thursday. CNN reported Thursday that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. He would not say whether those instances involved Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over. Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over. The Washington Post on Wednesday said the complaint referenced a \"promise\" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy. The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President. But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as \"urgent and credible\" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws. The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing. A President maligned?  If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached. The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a \"Deep State\" bent on overthrowing him, will grow. If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed. The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump. \"He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,\" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.\"If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected.\" \"This is an unconstitutional argument,\" Schlapp said on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack. According to three CNN sources, the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers. The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege. But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up. And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage. Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member. Whistleblowers exposed House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds. Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government. That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing. \"The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,\" the California Democrat said. \"Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law.\" The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny. And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 13, "Organization"], [78, 90, "Person"], [104, 112, "Time"], [135, 150, "Organization"], [155, 173, "Organization"], [223, 228, "Person"], [314, 321, "Location"], [543, 558, "Organization"], [586, 591, "Person"], [738, 743, "Person"], [1062, 1081, "Organization"], [1086, 1104, "Organization"], [1114, 1122, "Time"], [1158, 1163, "Person"], [1195, 1202, "Organization"], [1225, 1230, "Person"], [1266, 1279, "Person"], [1292, 1311, "Organization"], [1422, 1431, "Person"], [1459, 1462, "Organization"], [1465, 1476, "Person"], [1477, 1494, "Time"], [1496, 1504, "Person"], [1519, 1526, "Organization"], [1609, 1615, "Organization"], [1620, 1627, "Organization"], [1686, 1690, "Organization"], [1691, 1702, "Time"], [1728, 1743, "Organization"], [1745, 1753, "Person"], [1814, 1819, "Person"], [1964, 1981, "Organization"], [2262, 2270, "Person"], [2278, 2283, "Person"], [2368, 2382, "Time"], [2520, 2525, "Person"], [2408, 2416, "Person"], [2417, 2434, "Time"], [2791, 2796, "Person"], [2806, 2815, "Organization"], [2826, 2844, "Person"], [2845, 2855, "Time"], [2997, 3002, "Person"], [3004, 3019, "Organization"], [3309, 3314, "Person"], [3552, 3558, "Organization"], [3561, 3575, "Person"], [3580, 3591, "Organization"], [3594, 3605, "Person"], [3760, 3765, "Person"], [3774, 3785, "Time"], [3787, 3790, "Organization"], [3800, 3808, "Time"], [3872, 3904, "Organization"], [4014, 4019, "Person"], [4073, 4076, "Organization"], [4101, 4117, "Person"], [4189, 4210, "Organization"], [4211, 4225, "Person"], [4348, 4366, "Organization"], [4376, 4387, "Person"], [4454, 4473, "Organization"], [4474, 4486, "Time"], [4529, 4534, "Person"], [4578, 4581, "Organization"], [4741, 4744, "Organization"], [5355, 5360, "Person"], [5550, 5565, "Organization"], [5577, 5582, "Person"], [5767, 5772, "Person"], [6224, 6231, "Organization"], [6358, 6373, "Organization"], [6384, 6389, "Person"], [6531, 6559, "Organization"], [6567, 6579, "Person"], [6593, 6624, "Organization"], [6787, 6794, "Person"], [6803, 6806, "Organization"], [6843, 6858, "Organization"], [7035, 7038, "Organization"], [7047, 7063, "Organization"], [7068, 7090, "Organization"], [7115, 7136, "Organization"], [7263, 7278, "Organization"], [7625, 7637, "Person"], [7700, 7714, "Person"], [7767, 7771, "Person"], [7815, 7831, "Person"], [7922, 7927, "Person"], [7978, 7993, "Organization"], [8005, 8020, "Organization"], [8445, 8470, "Organization"], [8795, 8798, "Organization"], [8864, 8879, "Organization"], [8948, 8963, "Organization"], [9127, 9139, "Person"]]}
{"id": 107, "text": "The news that a whistleblower within the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Donald Trump and a foreign leader shook an already-shaky political Washington on Wednesday night.  While the whistleblower complaint had been an open secret inside the beltway for days, the Washington Post's new reporting that it was tied directly to the President of the United States -- and that Trump had made a \"promise\" to the foreign leader -- was an absolute bombshell. And yet, for all of the attention the story has, and will attract, there's still a ton we do not know -- and a bunch of questions tied to those lacunae in our knowledge.  Here are 5 of them. 1. Who was the foreign leader? According to the Post -- which cited official White House record -- there were five foreign leaders that Trump interacted with during the immediate period before the complaint was filed: Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and the Emir of Qatar. It's worth noting here, of course, that it's not clear whether that is the full list of foreign leaders Trump had contact with during that time or whether the complaint is tied to one of those five. If it is one of those five leaders, there are different levels of danger for Trump and the US. A Putin conversation would be at the top of that list given Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. Ditto North Korea. The Netherlands, on the other hand, might be a bit lower on the list of concern. 2. Who was listening to the conversation? Is there recorded audio? Earlier in Trump's tenure, specific details -- including transcripts -- about contentious conversations with foreign leaders in Australia and Mexico were leaked to reporters, causing significant embarrassment to Trump. That's a reminder that the President is almost never on the phone alone with a foreign leader. And that the calls are often recorded and a transcript circulated for people who are affected by the conversation but who weren't on the phone. But, while the Post has one source saying it was a phone call that triggered the whistleblower to act, we don't know that for sure yet. Trump, rising to his own defense, insisted on Twitter Thursday that the presence of other people on the calls was proof he had done nothing wrong. \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself,\" Trump tweeted, adding: \"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \"heavily populated\" call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" Worth noting here: Trump, in May 2017, revealed classified information about spy operations in Syria during an Oval Office meeting with two top Russian officials. So.... 3. Were there any actions before or after the incident that force the whistleblower's hand? All we know at this point is the whistleblower filed the complaint on August 12.  And that it was directly linked to a communication between Trump and a foreign leader that, according to the Post, involved a \"promise\" offered by Trump.  What we don't know is whether the whistleblower documented behavior by Trump (or others) either before the communication or immediately after it that led him or her to act. It's possible that the communication was the end result of a series of decisions made by Trump that were of concern to the whistleblower. Or that something the President or someone close to him did after the communication that brought the whistleblower to the point where he or she thought the only recourse was a complaint. 4. Why is the Director of National Intelligence not giving Congress the complaint? The complaint was filed August 12 to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Two weeks later he sent the complaint to acting DNI Joseph Maguire. By law, Maguire was supposed to turn over the complaint to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees within a week. Maguire has not done so. (Atkinson informed the relevant congressional committees that there had been a whistleblower complaint earlier this month without providing any details.) Citing Justice Department legal advice, Maguire has defended that decision by claiming the complaint involves some in the executive branch and is, therefore, not in his jurisdiction and is not of \"urgent concern.\" Atkinson is on Capitol Hill Thursday testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee in closed session. (Atkinson is not, according to CNN reporting, offering any information about the whistleblower case) Maguire, after much wrangling between the two sides, is set to testify in an open hearing next week.  5. Is what Trump did illegal? Almost certainly not. Even if Trump did disclose classified information in this communication with a foreign leader, he, as the President, has total power to declassify anything at any time. (To be clear: We do not know if the communication involved classified information. In a letter to Congress earlier this week, the DNI's office wrote only that the complaint involved \"confidential and potentially privileged matters.\" Whether or not Trump broke the law is just one consideration here, of course. Divulging any sort of \"confidential and potentially privileged\" information to a foreign leader -- as Trump did in May 2017 with the Russians -- could have broad ripple effects throughout the intelligence community including the possible compromising of sources and methods.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[121, 133, "Person"], [199, 217, "Time"], [188, 198, "Organization"], [389, 406, "Organization"], [419, 424, "Person"], [307, 326, "Organization"], [963, 974, "Person"], [941, 953, "Organization"], [907, 914, "Organization"], [925, 939, "Person"], [733, 741, "Organization"], [998, 1006, "Organization"], [1030, 1045, "Organization"], [1062, 1067, "Organization"], [1173, 1178, "Person"], [1365, 1370, "Person"], [1355, 1361, "Organization"], [1422, 1429, "Organization"], [1460, 1464, "Time"], [1800, 1809, "Organization"], [1814, 1820, "Organization"], [1683, 1688, "Person"], [1498, 1503, "Person"], [1511, 1522, "Organization"], [1524, 1539, "Organization"], [1884, 1889, "Person"], [2141, 2149, "Organization"], [2266, 2271, "Person"], [2320, 2328, "Time"], [2540, 2553, "Organization"], [2608, 2613, "Person"], [2863, 2870, "Organization"], [2892, 2897, "Person"], [2899, 2910, "Time"], [2968, 2973, "Location"], [3017, 3024, "Organization"], [3202, 3214, "Time"], [3322, 3330, "Time"], [3364, 3369, "Person"], [3443, 3449, "Person"], [3634, 3640, "Person"], [3896, 3917, "Organization"], [3977, 3986, "Time"], [4031, 4047, "Person"], [4101, 4115, "Person"], [4125, 4132, "Person"], [4176, 4185, "Organization"], [4190, 4220, "Organization"], [4236, 4243, "Person"], [4262, 4270, "Person"], [4422, 4440, "Organization"], [4455, 4463, "Person"], [4629, 4638, "Person"], [4644, 4656, "Location"], [4657, 4666, "Time"], [4689, 4721, "Organization"], [4742, 4751, "Person"], [4772, 4776, "Organization"], [4842, 4849, "Person"], [4955, 4961, "Person"], [4097, 4101, "Organization"], [5588, 5599, "Time"], [5578, 5584, "Person"], [5413, 5419, "Person"]]}
{"id": 108, "text": "It's still a mystery what exactly occurred and who exactly was involved, but a new report suggests a US intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint against the US President for, as the Washington Post reported, making a \"promise\" of some kind to a world leader. That an intelligence official was so distressed as to move against President Donald Trump in such a formal way is a remarkable development at a time when Trump's actions might have had you thinking it was not possible to be shocked any more. Trump says there's nothing to see here. \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\" he said on Twitter after the report was published by the Washington Post. \"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \"heavily populated\" call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" But his talks with world leaders, in public, on the phone and in private, have frequently dropped jaws to the ground either for their unprecedented nature, their awkward details or their instant reversal of US policy. He gave classified information to the Russian ambassador and foreign minister The day after he fired James Comey as FBI director, in part for not quashing the Russia investigation, Trump revealed classified information to the Russian foreign minister and then-ambassador during a meeting with the two in the Oval Office. The Russians later posted pictures of the meeting on social media.  He might not tell us about his interactions, but the Russians will Sometimes we find out about such interactions from the foreign country, such as when the Russian government posted about a call Trump had made to Putin and the White House waited hours to confirm it occurred. According to the White House, the call was about wildfires in Siberia and trade. According to the Russians, the call included a promise of help from the US in dealing with the fires. \"The President of Russia regards the US President's offer as a sign that it is possible that full-scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future,\" they posted on Facebook July 31. They also said the two had committed to routine phone calls in the future. He gives the impression he's agreeing with Putin Trump's meetings with Putin are routinely cause for concern and there have often been different interpretations about what happened in the meetings, such as when the Russians said after a two-hour meeting in July of 2017 that Trump accepted Putin's assurances that Russia had not interfered in the US election. Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump had raised the issue and the two had a robust conversation. He met alone with Putin and there are no detailed notes of what transpired Trump has met alone with Putin on the sidelines of large gatherings of world leaders. In January, there were reports that Trump, perhaps fearing leaks, has gone to great lengths to keep details of what was discussed during his private talks with Putin even from his top aides. There are no detailed records of many of his talks with Putin. \"You sit with the president of various countries,\" Trump said on Fox News in January after the report in the Washington Post. \"I do it with all countries. We had a great conversation, we were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things and it was a great conversation. I'm not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn't care less.\" He changes US policy on a whim Trump gave many concessions to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un as he sought an historic nuclear agreement, first in Singapore in 2018 and then at a second summit in Vietnam in 2019. Notably, he promised to drastically curb US military exercises with South Korea, which Trump, speaking up for North Korea, described as \"provocative.\" It was a move that took the US military by surprise. He admits things to world leaders he won't admit to American citizens Shortly after taking office, leaked written transcripts of calls between Trump and then-President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto, he asked repeatedly for the Mexican President to stop saying Mexico would not pay for the border wall. Trump said he'd been telling his supporters for years that they would. And he knowingly suggested it would \"come out in the wash.\" But he needed a commitment that they wouldn't publicly make an issue of it any more.  He also sought to allay the Mexican leader by saying the wall was the least important thing they were talking about even though the wall was the centerpiece of his presidential campaign and is the policy goal that has defined his presidency. He can become frustrated While deferential to leader like Putin and North Korea's Kim, Trump can become frustrated with other world leaders, as he did with then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Trump didn't want to honor an agreement between Turnbull and President Barack Obama regarding refugees. After a long and contentious back-and-forth, Trump told Turnbull, \"I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.\" He can berate US allies in their own country Trump criticized then-UK Prime Minister Theresa May during an interview with a British tabloid while he was in England in July of 2018. \"I told her how to do it,\" he said of May's approach on Brexit at the time, according to audio posted by the Sun. \"That will be up to her to say. But I told her how to do it. She wanted to go a different route.\"  He also seemed to endorse current Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the same interview. He can't take criticism His bromance with French President Emmanuel Macron may have already been on the rocks, but a phone call between the two on trade and migration went \"horribly\" after Macron criticized Trump's policies, sources told CNN's Michelle Kosinski and Maegan Vazquez. Trump had recently announced new steel tariffs and he had a similarly tense call with May. He also had a tense call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about tariffs in June of 2017. The White House described that call as \"amicable.\" The Canadian version of the readout suggested Trudeau disputed \"baseless\" claims by the US Department of Commerce about Canadian lumber and described him as promising to \"vigorously\" defend Canada. He makes things up But it's another meeting with Trudeau that is more telling. Trump told supporters at a fundraiser in Missouri in 2018 that he insisted during one meeting with Trudeau that the US has a trade deficit with Canada -- that it buys more from Canada than it sells to the country. Trudeau was right that the US has a trade surplus with Canada. \"I said, 'Wrong, Justin, you do.' I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, 'You're wrong,'\" Trump recalled. \"You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, 'You're wrong, Justin.' He said, 'Nope, we have no trade deficit.' I said, 'Well, in that case, I feel differently,' I said, 'but I don't believe it.'\" Trump later argued on Twitter, despite the facts published by his commerce department, that there is a deficit. He can come away with weird ideas about something serious like the climate crisis After a meeting with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, Trump suggested during a tour of California wildfires that authorities there might consider raking more in American forests. \"I was with the President of Finland and he said we have -- much different -- we are a forest nation. He called it a forest nation,\" Trump said. \"And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem. And when it is, it's a very small problem. So I know everybody's looking at that to that end.\" Niinistö later said he didn't recall the conversation.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[101, 116, "Organization"], [166, 172, "Organization"], [191, 210, "Organization"], [349, 361, "Person"], [426, 431, "Person"], [514, 519, "Person"], [681, 694, "Organization"], [814, 833, "Organization"], [1067, 1074, "Organization"], [1284, 1286, "Organization"], [1333, 1340, "Organization"], [1396, 1407, "Person"], [1411, 1414, "Organization"], [1454, 1460, "Organization"], [1476, 1481, "Person"], [1521, 1528, "Organization"], [1599, 1614, "Location"], [1836, 1858, "Organization"], [1879, 1885, "Person"], [1897, 1903, "Person"], [1907, 1922, "Organization"], [1973, 1988, "Organization"], [2022, 2029, "Location"], [2109, 2115, "Organization"], [2161, 2167, "Organization"], [2176, 2182, "Organization"], [2324, 2331, "Time"], [2451, 2456, "Person"], [2457, 2462, "Person"], [2479, 2484, "Person"], [2662, 2677, "Time"], [2683, 2689, "Person"], [2698, 2703, "Person"], [2722, 2728, "Organization"], [2751, 2757, "Organization"], [2792, 2805, "Person"], [2811, 2816, "Person"], [2895, 2901, "Person"], [2952, 2958, "Person"], [2977, 2983, "Person"], [3038, 3048, "Time"], [3074, 3079, "Person"], [3198, 3204, "Person"], [3285, 3290, "Person"], [3343, 3348, "Person"], [3357, 3365, "Organization"], [3366, 3376, "Time"], [3397, 3416, "Organization"], [3655, 3657, "Organization"], [3675, 3680, "Person"], [3706, 3717, "Organization"], [3727, 3738, "Person"], [3792, 3801, "Location"], [3802, 3809, "Time"], [3841, 3848, "Location"], [3849, 3856, "Time"], [3899, 3910, "Organization"], [3926, 3937, "Organization"], [3945, 3950, "Person"], [3968, 3979, "Organization"], [4037, 4048, "Organization"], [4205, 4210, "Person"], [4240, 4258, "Person"], [4233, 4239, "Organization"], [4288, 4295, "Organization"], [4321, 4327, "Organization"], [4363, 4368, "Person"], [4608, 4615, "Organization"], [4880, 4885, "Person"], [4890, 4901, "Organization"], [4904, 4907, "Person"], [4909, 4915, "Person"], [4983, 4993, "Organization"], [5009, 5025, "Person"], [5027, 5032, "Person"], [5075, 5083, "Person"], [5098, 5110, "Person"], [5176, 5181, "Person"], [5187, 5195, "Person"], [5298, 5303, "Person"], [5360, 5362, "Organization"], [5391, 5396, "Person"], [5413, 5415, "Organization"], [5431, 5442, "Person"], [5502, 5509, "Location"], [5510, 5525, "Time"], [5565, 5568, "Person"], [5632, 5639, "Organization"], [5789, 5802, "Person"], [5868, 5874, "Organization"], [5885, 5900, "Person"], [6070, 6087, "Person"], [6092, 6106, "Person"], [6108, 6114, "Person"], [6229, 6237, "Organization"], [6253, 6267, "Person"], [6282, 6297, "Time"], [6299, 6314, "Organization"], [6354, 6362, "Organization"], [6396, 6403, "Person"], [6434, 6463, "Organization"], [6540, 6546, "Organization"], [6597, 6604, "Person"], [6627, 6632, "Person"], [6668, 6676, "Location"], [6677, 6684, "Time"], [6726, 6733, "Person"], [6739, 6745, "Organization"], [6771, 6777, "Organization"], [6804, 6810, "Organization"], [6841, 6848, "Person"], [6864, 6870, "Organization"], [6896, 6902, "Organization"], [6921, 6927, "Person"], [7007, 7012, "Person"], [7121, 7127, "Person"], [7258, 7263, "Person"], [7473, 7480, "Organization"], [7491, 7505, "Person"], [7507, 7512, "Person"], [7540, 7550, "Location"], [7614, 7622, "Location"], [7661, 7668, "Organization"], [7765, 7770, "Person"], [7976, 7984, "Person"]]}
{"id": 109, "text": "A smoldering Washington intelligence mystery exploded late Wednesday into a full-on confrontation between House Democrats and the White House over communications between President Donald Trump and an unidentified foreign leader. A showdown over a whistleblower's \"credible and urgent\" complaint was revealed -- first by The Washington Post and later confirmed by CNN --  to concern the President himself, raising new questions about the motivation of the acting director of national intelligence's refusal to reveal details of the case to Congress. The revelations have unleashed a new firestorm in the nation's capital over Trump's perplexing foreign policy dealings and the administration's across-the-board efforts to frustrate Congress' constitutionally authorized role of oversight of the executive branch. But they will also open debate about the extent of the President's powers, which give him expansive latitude in national security.  The whistleblower's claims are also certain to bolster the belief among Trump and his supporters that nefarious forces are operating within America's intelligence establishment to undermine him -- a refrain conservatives have used in the wake of the Russian election interference operation. And they will likely further damage the President's trust in America's spy agencies. The Post reported that an official in the American intelligence community was so bothered by a \"promise\" Trump had made while communicating with a foreign leader that the official filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, according to two former US officials familiar with the matter. CNN has not confirmed the detail about the \"promise.\" It is unclear to whom Trump was speaking at the time.  The President dismissed the reporting on Thursday morning, rhetorically asking if there is \"anybody dumb enough to believe\" it. \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!,\" he tweeted. \"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" Trump said. The complaint was filed on August 12. White House records show Trump had spoken to or interacted with five foreign leaders in the previous five weeks, the Post reported: Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar. Trump's private, in-person meetings with Putin and Kim especially have intrigued observers. The Post's report, and CNN's subsequent confirmation, shed light on an intrigue that puzzled Washington for the last few days. The drama centers on the refusal of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to hand over the whistleblower's complaint to Congress. The stalling had already prompted speculation that Trump or senior aides could be involved. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday in a closed hearing that he was not allowed to provide details of the complaint, sources told CNN's Manu Raju. Under the law, the substance of a whistleblowers' claims cannot be provided until the report is sent to Congress. Democrats argue that the DNI is breaking the law by refusing to pass on the complaint, an accusation Maguire's office denies. After a standoff with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Maguire agreed Wednesday to testify next week, in a public hearing about the affair. There is no indication that he will hand over the report -- especially in an open hearing. Schiff had sent rumors into overdrive on Sunday when he said Maguire had cited a \"higher authority\" in refusing to hand over the complaint and referred to \"privileged communications.\" \"I think it's fair to assume this involves either the President or people around him or both,\" the California Democrat said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Thwarting oversight  The reports will trigger a controversy about Trump's handling of intelligence and his opaque conversations with foreign leaders. A political duel will also rage about the whistleblower's decision to make the complaint. On one hand, the President's sweeping powers in foreign policy conferred by the Constitution and a democratic mandate give him wide latitude to say whatever he likes to a foreign leader. American presidents have been making promises to their counterparts on the world stage for generations. It's a practice that might be said to be part of their job. Yet the exception would be if a president were engaging in contact antithetical to the interests of United States or carrying out illegal or unconstitutional acts that contravened his oath of office. There is no indication that is the case in the current controversy. Former FBI and CIA official Phil Mudd, who is now a CNN analyst, on Wednesday argued that it was unfair to expect a senior intelligence official to reveal sensitive information about a president's conversations to Congress and it was not the job of America's spies to monitor him. \"Can you explain to me a) why it is the US intelligence community's responsibility to listen to the President of the United States speaking to a foreign leader and b) why it is the US intelligence community, under the rules provided by the Democrats in Congress, (who) are responsible to report to the Congress what the President of the United States says?\" Mudd asked. \"When I served, we were responsible for chasing the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and terrorists,\" Mudd said on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\" \"We are not responsible for reporting to the Congress what the President says. He can say what he wants.\" Blocking Congress  Viewed another way, Maguire's conduct appears to be the latest manifestation of the administration's multi-front strategy to thwart Congress' oversight efforts. If an inspector general in a government department finds misconduct or uncovers information that rises to a high level of wrongdoing defined as \"urgent and credible\" under whistleblowing legislation, the legal recourse is to involve Congress. The controversy came to a head only a day after Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski put on an aggressive display in a House Judiciary Committee hearing that prompted the White House to preview a sweeping executive privilege claim even though he never worked for the federal government. The White House has sought to prevent testimony from many other current and former executive branch officials, leading to a string of looming court clashes that in themselves fulfill Trump's goal of slowing Democratic investigations. Maguire is a retired Navy admiral who formerly led the National Counterterrorism Center. He was chosen by Trump following a succession drama after the permanent director -- former Sen. Dan Coats, who was never seen as close to the President -- announced he would step down in July. Trump passed over the office's No. 2, Sue Gordon. Sources told CNN at the time she was not seen as the kind of loyalist Trump wanted in the role. At the time, Maguire was seen as a force for stability. Trump's first pick to replace Coats, Rep. John Ratcliffe, stepped down after controversy over the Texas Republican's qualifications and amid concern he would be a political appointee who would first be loyal to the President, not his duty as director of national intelligence. Witnesses armed with letters   Schiff announced Wednesday that Maguire will appear before the House Intelligence Committee at 9 a.m. on September 26.  His comment over the weekend that Maguire was citing privilege considerations raises the prospect that the committee could see a replay of a now-familiar scenario. Witnesses are increasingly showing up at hearings -- like Lewandowski -- armed with letters from the White House lawyers advising them to limit their testimony to issues not likely to be involved in expansive future executive privilege claims. Schiff said Monday that he does not know the exact nature of the complaint, as he has not yet received the details from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  The California Democrat also doesn't know the identity of the whistleblower. The acting director's letter Tuesday to Schiff, obtained by CNN, states that the complaint does not involve anyone in the intelligence community but rather \"stakeholders within the Executive Branch.\" As a result, its lawyer argues, the complaint is not of \"urgent concern\" to the office. The Senate Intelligence Committee is also getting involved in the case.  The panel's top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, told reporters that he and his Republican counterpart \"want to get answers. We need to protect whistleblowers and we hope to get some resolution next week.\" Its chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, earlier declined to comment, but, while saying he would follow the whistleblower's progress, added, \"That's not typically something that Congress gets involved in.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[13, 23, "Organization"], [54, 68, "Time"], [106, 121, "Organization"], [126, 141, "Organization"], [180, 192, "Person"], [320, 339, "Organization"], [363, 367, "Organization"], [1016, 1021, "Person"], [1194, 1201, "Organization"], [1320, 1328, "Organization"], [1425, 1430, "Person"], [1660, 1663, "Organization"], [1736, 1741, "Organization"], [1807, 1818, "Time"], [2024, 2037, "Organization"], [2349, 2356, "Organization"], [2359, 2364, "Person"], [2395, 2407, "Time"], [2409, 2420, "Organization"], [2434, 2439, "Person"], [2522, 2530, "Organization"], [2559, 2573, "Person"], [2541, 2548, "Organization"], [2575, 2587, "Organization"], [2597, 2608, "Person"], [2610, 2619, "Organization"], [2635, 2645, "Person"], [2647, 2652, "Organization"], [2668, 2678, "Person"], [2695, 2700, "Organization"], [2702, 2707, "Person"], [2743, 2748, "Person"], [2753, 2756, "Person"], [2794, 2802, "Organization"], [2817, 2820, "Organization"], [2964, 2997, "Organization"], [2998, 3012, "Person"], [3184, 3200, "Person"], [3207, 3239, "Organization"], [3240, 3251, "Time"], [3346, 3349, "Organization"], [3352, 3361, "Person"], [3498, 3505, "Organization"], [3578, 3585, "Person"], [3625, 3643, "Organization"], [3653, 3664, "Person"], [3666, 3673, "Person"], [3681, 3690, "Time"], [3880, 3889, "Time"], [3903, 3910, "Person"], [4121, 4144, "Organization"], [4153, 4156, "Organization"], [4243, 4248, "Person"], [4868, 4881, "Organization"], [5043, 5046, "Organization"], [5051, 5054, "Organization"], [5064, 5073, "Person"], [5088, 5091, "Organization"], [5101, 5113, "Time"], [5353, 5359, "Organization"], [5430, 5447, "Organization"], [5494, 5501, "Organization"], [5553, 5578, "Organization"], [5650, 5667, "Organization"], [5675, 5679, "Person"], [5735, 5747, "Organization"], [5749, 5760, "Organization"], [5762, 5774, "Organization"], [5792, 5796, "Person"], [5970, 5977, "Person"], [6434, 6451, "Person"], [6402, 6407, "Person"], [6484, 6511, "Organization"], [6534, 6549, "Organization"], [6654, 6669, "Organization"], [6888, 6895, "Person"], [6939, 6975, "Organization"], [7073, 7082, "Person"], [7161, 7168, "Time"], [7208, 7218, "Person"], [7233, 7236, "Organization"], [7290, 7295, "Person"], [7329, 7336, "Person"], [7402, 7407, "Person"], [7372, 7377, "Person"], [7414, 7428, "Person"], [7712, 7719, "Person"], [7697, 7706, "Time"], [7739, 7771, "Organization"], [7772, 7781, "Time"], [7782, 7797, "Time"], [8022, 8033, "Person"], [7834, 7841, "Person"], [8061, 8076, "Organization"], [8208, 8214, "Person"], [7680, 7686, "Person"], [8220, 8226, "Time"], [8358, 8379, "Organization"], [8499, 8505, "Person"], [8488, 8495, "Time"], [8519, 8522, "Organization"], [8747, 8780, "Organization"], [8851, 8862, "Person"], [8866, 8874, "Organization"], [9052, 9064, "Person"]]}
{"id": 110, "text": "A communication between President Donald Trump and a foreign leader prompted a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute between the director of national intelligence and Congress, a source familiar with the case told CNN. The concern was first revealed by The Washington Post, which reported that an official in the American intelligence community was so bothered by a \"promise\" Trump made to a foreign leader that the official filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, citing two former US officials familiar with the matter. CNN has not independently confirmed the detail about a \"promise\" made to  the foreign leader. The source who spoke to CNN would not disclose the foreign leader with whom Trump was alleged to have spoken. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The President dismissed the reporting on Thursday morning, rhetorically asking if there is \"anybody dumb enough to believe\" it. \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!,\" he tweeted. \"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" Trump said. The details of the complaint are shrouded in mystery, even as the fight between the House Intelligence Committee and acting director of national intelligence has been brought to the fore by committee Chairman Adam Schiff. While not privy to the details of the complaint, the California Democrat wrote in a letter to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last week that, from what he has gleaned, he believes \"the serious misconduct at issue involves the President of the United States and/or other senior White House or Administration officials.\" It's the first time Trump's direct involvement in the complaint has been reported, according to the Post. The complaint was filed on August 12. White House records show Trump had spoken to or interacted with five foreign leaders in the previous five weeks, the Post reports: Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and the Emir of Qatar. However, it's not clear that the communication that inspired the complaint was with any of those leaders. A lawyer representing the whistleblower declined to comment to the Post.  The complaint has led to a standoff between Congress and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has refused to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee. Maguire has agreed to testify next week in an open session before the committee after refusing to comply with Tuesday's deadline to hand over the whistleblower complaint, which had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be \"credible and urgent.\"  Schiff announced Wednesday that Maguire will appear at 9 a.m. on September 26. The California Democrat also announced that the intelligence community inspector general will brief the House committee Thursday behind closed doors about how it handled the whistleblower complaint.  On Tuesday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence sent letters to Schiff and ranking Republican  Rep. Devin Nunes of California, saying not only that Maguire was refusing to provide the requested information -- as the complaint \"does not meet the definition of 'urgent concern' \" -- but also that he would not appear before the committee as scheduled because he \"is not available on such short notice.\" But by Wednesday, the two sides appeared to have reached a compromise, if only on the timing of the hearing, setting the stage for what could be a contentious public hearing. Maguire will likely be grilled by lawmakers concerned that the administration may have violated whistleblower protections and whether President Donald Trump or top White House officials were involved in the case. Schiff said Monday that he does not know the exact nature of the complaint, as he has not yet received the details from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, nor does he know the whistleblower's identity. He has argued that Maguire has taken unprecedented steps to withhold the information from Congress. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's letter Tuesday to Schiff, obtained by CNN, the complaint does not involve anyone in the intelligence community but rather \"stakeholders within the Executive Branch.\" As a result, its lawyer argues, the complaint is not of \"urgent concern\" to the office. The office wrote that it plans to work with the House intelligence Committee but given that executive branch members are involved, there are \"confidential and potentially privileged matters\" that \"will necessarily require appropriate consultations.\" In response, Schiff said in a statement Tuesday: \"The IC IG determined that the complaint is both credible and urgent, which is why the Committee must move quickly. The Committee's position is clear -- the Acting DNI can either provide the complaint as required under the law, or he will be required to come before the Committee to tell the public why he is not following the clear letter of the law, including whether the White House or the Attorney General are directing him to do so. He has yet to provide the complaint in response to the Committee's subpoena, so I expect him to appear on Thursday, under subpoena if necessary.\" While Schiff appeared willing to work with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on the date of Maguire's hearing, he maintained that the complaint should still be given to Congress. \"The IC IG determined that this complaint is both credible and urgent, and that it should be transmitted to Congress under the clear letter of the law. The committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistleblowers and their complaints to Congress,\" he said Wednesday.  Schiff is demanding that Maguire turn over the intelligence community inspector general's \"determination and all records pertaining to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's (ODNI) involvement in this matter, including any and all correspondence with other Executive Branch actors such as the White House,\" according to last week's news release from the congressman's office. Schiff also argued that Maguire had acted outside the authority of his post by consulting with the Department of Justice about the complaint as he involved \"another entity within the Executive Branch in the handling of a whistleblower complaint.\" Schiff declined to say whether he has been contacted by the whistleblower or their legal representation, saying he wouldn't want to jeopardize them. A source familiar with the case told CNN that the Intelligence Community Whistleblowers Protection Act likely offers only one real path forward: circumventing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and giving the complaint directly to the committee. That route may also be complicated, the source warned, noting it could raise classification issues tied to transmitting the material.

{"id": 111, "text": "Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said Thursday that a recent whistleblower complaint about a communication between President Donald Trump and a foreign leader is \"incredibly concerning.\" \"I think you are right. This President has a history of treating classified information and sensitive information questionably at best,\" McCabe, a CNN contributor, told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\"  The concern was first revealed by The Washington Post, which reported that an official in the American intelligence community was so bothered by a \"promise\" Trump made to a foreign leader that the official filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, citing two former US officials familiar with the matter. CNN has not independently confirmed the detail about a \"promise\" made to the foreign leader. The revelation has opened fresh concerns about Trump's dealings with foreign leaders, though the matter is shrouded in mystery as its details remain under wraps. McCabe, who also served as deputy director of the FBI, appeared baffled by the complaint Thursday, telling Berman that \"it's unfortunate that we're left to kind of piece together ... the puzzle.\" \"But the fact that we now know it was the President and we know it involved some sort of a promise to a (foreign) leader is deeply concerning,\" McCabe said.  A source familiar with the case who spoke to CNN would not disclose the foreign leader with whom Trump was reported to have spoken. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, and the White House has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The Post said its report was the first time Trump's direct involvement in the complaint, which was filed August 12, has been reported. White House records show Trump had spoken to or interacted with five foreign leaders in the previous five weeks, the Post reports: Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and the Emir of Qatar. However, it's not clear the communication that inspired the complaint was with any of those leaders. Trump's handling of sensitive national intelligence has previously been scrutinized. CNN reported earlier this month that in 2017, the US extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government in part due to concerns that Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[14, 17, "Organization"], [27, 40, "Person"], [46, 54, "Time"], [133, 145, "Person"], [332, 338, "Person"], [342, 345, "Organization"], [364, 367, "Organization"], [370, 381, "Person"], [431, 450, "Organization"], [554, 559, "Person"], [757, 760, "Person"], [897, 902, "Person"], [1012, 1018, "Person"], [1062, 1065, "Organization"], [1101, 1109, "Time"], [1119, 1125, "Person"], [1352, 1358, "Person"], [1411, 1414, "Organization"], [1463, 1468, "Person"], [1528, 1549, "Organization"], [1575, 1590, "Organization"], [1612, 1615, "Organization"], [1639, 1647, "Organization"], [1683, 1688, "Person"], [1744, 1753, "Time"], [1774, 1785, "Organization"], [1799, 1804, "Person"], [1887, 1895, "Organization"], [1905, 1912, "Organization"], [1923, 1937, "Person"], [1939, 1951, "Organization"], [1961, 1972, "Person"], [1996, 2004, "Organization"], [2032, 2043, "Organization"], [2060, 2065, "Organization"], [2167, 2173, "Person"], [2253, 2256, "Organization"], [2266, 2284, "Time"], [2290, 2297, "Time"], [2299, 2305, "Organization"], [2321, 2327, "Organization"], [2379, 2386, "Organization"], [2427, 2432, "Person"]]}
{"id": 112, "text": "Former national security adviser John Bolton didn't offer any praise of President Donald Trump in remarks at a private event Wednesday, but instead took aim at his former boss' policies on the world stage, according to an attendee.  Bolton, who Trump fired earlier this month, made comments at an event hosted by the Gatestone Institute in New York that the attendee characterized to CNN as scathing in their criticism of Trump's approach to Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan. Politico was first to report on Bolton's remarks. \"Bolton didn't have anything positive to say about Trump,\" the attendee said.  While Bolton did not mention Trump by name, he said the idea of inviting the Taliban to Camp David was \"disrespectful\" to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to the attendee. As CNN previously reported, Bolton and Trump got into a heated argument over the President's plan to host the Taliban leaders in the days before the 18th anniversary of the attacks, and Bolton did not back down, two people familiar with what happened said. One senior official confirmed this argument happened in the Oval Office and at the end of the meeting, the President asked Bolton for his resignation. Bolton's exit made him the latest national security figure the Trump administration has plowed through, even as multiple geopolitical crises have played out. Trump's approach to national security -- and his penchant for threatening other countries over Twitter -- has made national security roles within the Trump administration increasingly difficult to navigate.  In June, Trump said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has \"kept his word\" when it comes to nuclear and missile testing -- a direct contradiction of Bolton, who just hours earlier had accused Pyongyang of failing to follow through on its commitments. Trump sparked similar confusion in July when he told reporters that Afghanistan \"would be wiped off the face of the Earth\" if he wanted to win the war in the region. Bolton went on to tell the attendees on Wednesday that the administration believes Iran has been behind other disruptive drone strikes, including one on a NATO convoy in Afghanistan, according to the attendee in the room for the remarks.  Bolton told the attendees he believed that letting these attacks go unanswered is simply encouraging Iran's bad behavior.  In wide-ranging comments to reporters in the Oval Office last week, Trump held forth on Iran and Afghanistan, pausing to criticize Bolton for his positions on Iraq and North Korea and make clear he disagreed with his former adviser's stance on Venezuela. While Bolton had pushed tough measures against Iran and North Korea -- and in the past has advocated the use of military force against both -- Trump praised the potential of both countries and did not rule out easing sanctions on Tehran, a change the regime is demanding before it will engage in talks.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[33, 44, "Person"], [82, 94, "Person"], [125, 134, "Time"], [233, 239, "Person"], [245, 250, "Person"], [313, 336, "Person"], [340, 348, "Location"], [384, 387, "Organization"], [422, 427, "Person"], [442, 446, "Organization"], [448, 459, "Organization"], [464, 475, "Organization"], [477, 485, "Organization"], [509, 515, "Person"], [528, 534, "Person"], [578, 583, "Person"], [612, 618, "Person"], [635, 640, "Person"], [679, 690, "Organization"], [694, 704, "Location"], [743, 765, "Time"], [816, 819, "Organization"], [841, 847, "Person"], [852, 857, "Person"], [919, 930, "Organization"], [999, 1005, "Person"], [1193, 1199, "Person"], [1221, 1227, "Person"], [1284, 1289, "Person"], [1379, 1384, "Person"], [1529, 1534, "Person"], [1587, 1594, "Time"], [1596, 1601, "Person"], [1607, 1619, "Organization"], [1627, 1638, "Person"], [1733, 1739, "Person"], [1776, 1785, "Organization"], [1835, 1840, "Person"], [1867, 1874, "Time"], [1903, 1914, "Organization"], [2001, 2007, "Person"], [2038, 2050, "Time"], [2084, 2088, "Organization"], [2156, 2160, "Organization"], [2171, 2182, "Organization"], [2240, 2246, "Person"], [2404, 2419, "Location"], [2431, 2436, "Person"], [2451, 2455, "Organization"], [2460, 2471, "Organization"], [2494, 2500, "Person"], [2522, 2526, "Person"], [2531, 2542, "Person"], [2607, 2616, "Organization"], [2624, 2630, "Person"], [2665, 2669, "Organization"], [2674, 2685, "Organization"], [2761, 2766, "Person"], [2848, 2854, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 116, "text": "The US Treasury Department has further sanctioned North Korea for its long-established efforts to hack financial institutions around the world, saying the money is used to help fund the country's missile programs. Specifically, the US announced sanctions against three North Korean state sponsored cyber groups responsible for \"malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure,\" the Treasury Department announced in a statement on Friday. The US claims the group known as the \"Lazarus Group,\" and two of its sub-groups, \"Bluenoroff,\" and \"Andariel\" are \"agencies, instrumentalities, or controlled entities of the Government of North Korea.\" \"Treasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,\" Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said in a statement.  \"We will continue to enforce existing US and UN sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.\" The 'Lazarus Group'  was involved in the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017, which the US and other allies said was the work of the North Korean government. For years, North Korea's intelligence apparatus has heavily targeted victims where they can directly siphon money, like the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016.  The practice has become extremely lucrative: Earlier this year, the United Nations said that the country's habit of hacking bitcoin exchanges has netted as much as $2 billion. Specifically, the US said that hacking functions to \"potentially fund North Korea's WMD and ballistic missile programs.\" \"They're essentially calling out their criminal activity that's been going on for four years,\" John Hulquist, the director intelligence analysis for FireEye, which tracks North Korea's cyber activity, told CNN. \"The real question is will the sanctions have any effect.\" North Korea's adoption of cybercrime as a major means of funding the regime has a cyclical effect: it was likely adopted as a response to international sanctions making it difficult to make money, but further isolates the country on the world stage, which may make it even more dependent on hacking to stay financially float. \"Just because it might not stop the behavior doesn't mean we shouldn't illuminate it,\" Hulquist said. \"It's still the right thing to do and maybe the smart thing to do because it's on the table now for negotiations,\" he said. Third summit possible? The sanctions announcement comes as President Donald Trump continues to leave the door open for a possible third summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.  Trump hinted at high level contacts with Pyongyang again this week after firing his hawkish national security adviser John Bolton. The President made it clear that he believed Bolton's presence was harmful to the diplomatic process and was at least partially to blame for the lack of progress in denuclearization talks.  \"We were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model, and he made a mistake. And as soon as he mentioned that, the Libyan model, what a disaster,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday, the day after Bolton's departure.  \"Take a look at what happened with Gadhafi with the Libyan model, and he's using that to make a deal with North Korea? And I don't blame Kim Jong Un for anything he said after that, he wanted nothing to do with John Bolton. And that's not a question of being not tough ... that's a question of being not smart to say something like that,\" he added. On Monday, a top North Korean diplomat working on nuclear negotiations with the United States said Pyongyang would be open to resuming talks with Washington. The envoy, Choe Son Hui, said in a first-person statement published Monday by North Korean state media that North Korea is willing \"to sit with the US side for comprehensive discussions of the issues we have so far taken up at the time and place to be agreed late in September.\" \"I believe that the US side will come out with a proposal geared to the interests of the DPRK and the US and based on the calculation method acceptable to us,\" Choe said, referring to North Korea by an acronym for the country's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Just hours later, North Korea launched two unidentified projectiles from South Pyongan Province toward the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.  After more than a year of refraining from missile tests, Kim's regime has conducted 10 launches since May, including the one on Tuesday. Most of those are believed to be short-range missiles, and experts say they have shown impressive technological advancements. Trump has played down the tests when speaking about North Korea publicly. At one point he referred to them as \"very standard.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 26, "Organization"], [50, 61, "Organization"], [228, 234, "Organization"], [382, 405, "Organization"], [431, 440, "Time"], [442, 448, "Organization"], [612, 641, "Organization"], [480, 493, "Organization"], [524, 534, "Organization"], [542, 550, "Organization"], [679, 691, "Organization"], [798, 813, "Person"], [941, 943, "Organization"], [948, 950, "Organization"], [969, 980, "Organization"], [1077, 1090, "Organization"], [1144, 1151, "Time"], [1159, 1165, "Organization"], [1204, 1231, "Organization"], [1244, 1255, "Organization"], [1353, 1375, "Organization"], [1376, 1384, "Time"], [1450, 1468, "Organization"], [1576, 1582, "Organization"], [1632, 1642, "Organization"], [1778, 1791, "Person"], [1832, 1839, "Organization"], [1854, 1865, "Organization"], [1889, 1892, "Organization"], [1953, 1965, "Organization"], [2653, 2665, "Organization"], [2675, 2686, "Person"], [2574, 2586, "Person"], [2689, 2694, "Person"], [2730, 2739, "Location"], [2807, 2818, "Person"], [2865, 2871, "Person"], [3044, 3055, "Person"], [3069, 3079, "Organization"], [3144, 3154, "Organization"], [3180, 3185, "Person"], [3204, 3219, "Location"], [3220, 3229, "Time"], [3245, 3251, "Person"], [3301, 3308, "Person"], [3314, 3324, "Organization"], [3372, 3383, "Organization"], [3403, 3414, "Person"], [3477, 3488, "Person"], [3615, 3624, "Time"], [3632, 3644, "Organization"], [3691, 3708, "Organization"], [3714, 3723, "Organization"], [3761, 3771, "Organization"], [3784, 3796, "Person"], [3841, 3847, "Time"], [3851, 3863, "Location"], [3881, 3892, "Organization"], [3917, 3923, "Organization"], [4032, 4049, "Time"], [4068, 4074, "Organization"], [4137, 4145, "Organization"], [4150, 4156, "Organization"], [4212, 4216, "Person"], [4236, 4247, "Organization"], [4293, 4334, "Organization"], [4354, 4365, "Organization"], [4409, 4431, "Organization"], [4439, 4451, "Location"], [4467, 4483, "Organization"], [4543, 4546, "Person"], [4582, 4591, "Time"], [4611, 4621, "Time"], [4749, 4754, "Person"], [4801, 4812, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 124, "text": "A group of Democratic US senators on Thursday sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to escalate diplomatic action against North Korea following months of missile launches from the country, which have received little pushback from the administration. \"We write to express our grave concern regarding your policy and diplomacy with North Korea,\" the senators write, \"and to urge you to redouble efforts to forge a successful and durable path towards denuclearization of North Korea -- by diplomatic means -- while the opportunity still exists.\" The letter, which is signed by eight Senate Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, presses Trump to acknowledge that North Korea's spate of missile launches in recent months contravene United Nations Security Council resolutions. The senators urge the President to push for UN enforcement against the country. This comes as Trump has largely downplayed the missiles as not a breach of understandings he has with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  \"Your administration has downplayed the significance of these tests and suggested that there is no rush to reach an agreement that verifiably freezes and reverses North Korea's nuclear and missile development,\" the letter says. \"Accepting North Korean ballistic missile tests represents, in our view, a significant step backwards in the negotiations, especially as you yourself have previously asserted that North Korea halting all ballistic missile tests and nuclear tests was a sign of your administration's success.\" The senators write that Trump's ability to address North Korea's missile testing \"is vital for our national security interests, and we want to support your administration in the execution of a coherent, durable and sustainable strategy.\" While the Trump administration's negotiations with North Korea and Kim have yielded multiple high profile meetings, the country's continued missile tests paired with the President's dismissive approach have sparked concerns about future relations between the two countries. Speaking to reporters last month about the missile launches, Trump said, \"There have been no nuclear tests. The missile tests have all been short-ranged -- no ballistic missile test.\" Additionally, contradictions within the administration over North Korea's actions have escalated concerns. In June, Trump said Kim has \"kept his word\" when it comes to nuclear and missile testing, contradicting national security adviser John Bolton who hours earlier accused Pyongyang of failing to follow through on its commitments. Speaking with Voice of America last month, Bolton said the US hasn't had \"substantive negotiations\" with North Korea since Trump's meeting with Kim in June.  \"We're hoping those talks begin soon,\" he said. \"The real issue is whether North Korea will make the clear strategic decision to give up its nuclear weapons and its delivery system.\" The letter also hits Trump for \"calling into question\" US allies and the merits of combined military exercises which Democrats say are critical to \"safeguard US national interests.\"  \"Threatening to unravel the integrity of our alliance architecture in Asia makes us less capable of dealing with North Korea, not more.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[34, 45, "Time"], [73, 85, "Person"], [135, 146, "Organization"], [343, 354, "Organization"], [481, 492, "Organization"], [643, 656, "Person"], [666, 671, "Person"], [760, 791, "Organization"], [849, 851, "Organization"], [899, 904, "Person"], [987, 999, "Organization"], [1007, 1018, "Person"], [1184, 1195, "Organization"], [1260, 1272, "Organization"], [1429, 1440, "Organization"], [1565, 1570, "Person"], [1592, 1603, "Organization"], [1789, 1794, "Person"], [1830, 1841, "Organization"], [1846, 1850, "Person"], [2297, 2308, "Organization"], [2353, 2358, "Person"], [2344, 2351, "Time"], [2364, 2367, "Person"], [2474, 2485, "Person"], [2512, 2521, "Organization"], [2585, 2601, "Organization"], [2602, 2612, "Time"], [2614, 2620, "Person"], [2626, 2632, "Organization"], [2676, 2687, "Organization"], [2694, 2699, "Person"], [2715, 2718, "Person"], [2719, 2726, "Time"], [2804, 2815, "Organization"], [2967, 2969, "Organization"], [3070, 3072, "Organization"], [3165, 3169, "Location"], [3208, 3219, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 127, "text": "It's been five years since then-President Barack Obama gave a news conference at the White House and announced \"we don't have a strategy yet\" to combat ISIS in Syria. It was a serious and consequential development, which, Obama added, he hoped to remedy shortly by meeting with his military and national security advisers.  Yet, when the news conference ended, the general talk of the day was not about a lack of strategy in the fight against a terror group in the Middle East. Instead, it was about taupe, the color of the suit Obama was wearing that day. Five years in Washington can feel like a lifetime ago, and the way Obama's suit was covered then, versus where something as trivial would fall in today's news cycle, is for many an example of just how much the times have changed.  The crux of the issue was the shock of seeing Obama stepping out on his normal, traditional blue or gray suits that it caused such a divisive disturbance in America's normal sartorial acceptance of the President's choices. New York Rep. Peter King zeroed in on it during a CNN appearance at the time, saying it made the country look less serious about taking on ISIS.  \"(Obama) looked like he was on his way to a party at the Hamptons,\" King had said. Headlines abounded -- \"Yes we Tan!\" and \"The audacity of taupe\" -- Fox News' Lou Dobbs went so far as to call it \"un-presidential\" and tried to surmise Obama was sending some sort of hidden message, possibly to our enemies, via the suit color. In 2014, serious policy -- the Syrian conflict featuring ISIS -- was usurped by the absurdity of a suit's color. In 2019, it sometimes feels like the absurd can be the serious policy.  This week alone, it's been reported President Donald Trump has discussed nuking hurricanes, waffled on Chinese trade deals, implied the first lady of the United States had gotten to know the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and wished a happy birthday to the man who runs World Wrestling Entertainment.  This is just a sampling. Perhaps, then, a more ebullient White House press corps was easily distracted from topics than they would be today -- a President announcing he had no definitive strategy as he simultaneously sent more US troops abroad. But five years ago, Washington seemed more inclined to trade jabs about the ridiculousness of Obama's fashion choices than to double-down on the legitimate content of the news conference. Not that there weren't any stories or focus on the ISIS crisis -- there were. But the larger takeaway from the day, in terms of the country's popular vernacular, was that Obama should/should not have worn tan. So robust was the talk of the suit it forced then-press secretary Josh Earnest to tell reporters the following day that Obama still \"feels pretty good about his decision\" to wear it.  \"The President stands squarely behind the decision he made yesterday to wear his summer suit at yesterday's news conference,\" said Earnest, a frequent presence at the briefing room podium, which has been left abandoned by a press secretary now for going on 170 days.  The month before Obama's news conference, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian was arrested in Iran on espionage charges and eventually convicted in an Iranian trial.

{"id": 130, "text": "As summer turns to fall and the East Coast prepares for the heart of hurricane season, it's nice to know that President Donald Trump has a plan for how to combat these terrifying natural disasters: USING LETHAL FORCE!!! In the latest \"Wait, is this an Onion headline or is this reality\" moment of a presidency chock full of them, Axios reported in late August that the President has repeatedly raised the possibility of dropping nuclear weapons into hurricanes to dissolve them before they ever endanger land. \"They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?,\" Trump reportedly asked aides during one hurricane briefing. The response to the idea was, uh, muted, according to Axios. \"You could hear a gnat fart in that meeting,\" one source in the room told Axios. \"People were astonished.\" Trump, for his part, denied the story -- using his customary third person. \"The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous,\" he tweeted amid the G7 meetings in France. \"I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!\" (Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, who wrote the story, responded this way to Trump's tweet: \"I stand by every word in the story. He said this in at least two meetings during the first year and a bit of the presidency, and one of the conversations was memorialized.\") Let's just say, hypothetically, Trump did float the idea of nuking hurricanes because, knowing him, he almost certainly did. Might it actually work? The answer to that question is a resounding \"No.\" Or so says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. According to the NOAA: \"Apart from the fact that this might not even alter the storm, this approach neglects the problem that the released radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the tradewinds to affect land areas and cause devastating environmental problems. Needless to say, this is not a good idea.\" That explanation not satisfying enough? How about this one -- for you nerds out there: \"A fully developed hurricane can release heat energy at a rate of 5 to 20x1013 watts and converts less than 10% of the heat into the mechanical energy of the wind. The heat release is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes.\" So, if I'm reading that right, it means that a hurricane is stronger -- in terms of energy -- than a nuclear bomb. Like, way stronger.  \"Over my 35 years as a meteorologist I have received calls & handwritten letters from people proposing this,\" tweeted John Morales, the chief meteorologist for NBC's affiliate in Miami, an area that knows something about hurricanes. \"I gently try to explain to them that according to @NASA a hurricane can expend as much energy as 10,000 nuclear bombs during its life cycle. Futile and obviously dangerous.\" Now, just because dropping a nuclear bomb into a hurricane wouldn't work, doesn't mean Trump is the first person ever to consider doing it.  Way back in 1961, the head of the US Weather Service said in a speech that he could \"imagine the possibility someday of exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea.\" Right around that same time, the Pentagon formed something called Project Plowshare, which was aimed at finding non-military uses for nuclear weapons. Jack Reed, a trained meteorologist, wrote an extensive proposal to Plowshare that aimed at dropping nuclear weapons into the eye of hurricanes. Reed believed that the heat produced by a nuclear explosion would, in effect, blow up the eye of the hurricane and, in so doing, derail or significantly weaken it. How would the nuclear bomb be injected into the storm? By submarine, of course! The science community now agrees that a nuclear weapon just wouldn't work. Plus, nuking a hurricane would be illegal! Under the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty between Russia and the United States, there are strict limits on how and when the two superpowers can use nuclear weapons of any sort. None of that stops Trump from considering it, of course.   Nuking hurricanes is in line with his long-held fascination with and trust in nuclear power and nuclear weapons. As far back as 1984, Trump has talked about the threat and promise of nuclear power. In an interview with The Washington Post at that time, he suggested he could handle nuclear negotiations between Russia and the United States. \"It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles,\" Trump said of his hypothetical negotiator role. \"I think I know most of it anyway.\" More recently, Trump issued a nuclear threat to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un on Twitter:  \"Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\" Trump's nuclear button might work.

{"id": 152, "text": "North Korean officials indicated to a national security administration official last week that working level talks could start very soon, a senior administration official said Tuesday.  The North Koreans made the comments while the national security official was at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) delivering photos from President Donald Trump's recent meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Both the US and North Korea will have representatives at this week's ASEAN meetings in Bangkok, but it is unclear if they will meet. The senior administration official said that the North Koreans were sending a lower-level official in lieu of their foreign minister. A State Department spokesperson said that Special Representative for North Korea Steve Biegun would accompany Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Thailand's capital \"for ASEAN related meetings.\" Following his June meeting with Kim in the DMZ, Trump declared that working level talks would start within weeks. They had not begun more than a month later. In that time, however, the North Koreans test fired two short range ballistic missiles. North Korean media outlet KCNA reported that the launches were \"personally organized\" by Kim as a warning to South Korea ahead of joint military exercises with the US. Both Trump and Pompeo seemed to downplay the significance of the launches. Trump noted on Friday that \"they are short-range missiles and many people have those missiles.\"  \"Everybody tries to get ready for negotiations and create leverage, and create risk for the other side,\" Pompeo said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week. In that same interview, the secretary of state said he anticipated that discussions between the two sides would begin \"in a couple weeks.\" \"Everybody's got to get schedules right,\" he said. \"More importantly than the date, if we wait two weeks or four weeks or six weeks to make sure that we've had enough conversations so that there can be productive dialogue when the teams get together, that's the real objective. If it takes us another two weeks or four weeks, so be it.\" Speaking in Washington on Monday, Pompeo said there was \"nothing in the works\" for a third Trump-Kim summit.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 12, "Organization"], [80, 89, "Time"], [176, 183, "Time"], [186, 203, "Organization"], [266, 295, "Location"], [335, 347, "Location"], [370, 382, "Organization"], [390, 401, "Person"], [408, 414, "Organization"], [419, 430, "Organization"], [472, 477, "Organization"], [490, 497, "Location"], [585, 598, "Organization"], [672, 688, "Organization"], [739, 750, "Organization"], [751, 763, "Person"], [799, 810, "Person"], [838, 843, "Organization"], [814, 822, "Location"], [877, 881, "Time"], [895, 898, "Person"], [911, 916, "Person"], [1109, 1121, "Location"], [1135, 1139, "Organization"], [1198, 1201, "Person"], [1218, 1229, "Organization"], [1269, 1275, "Organization"], [1282, 1287, "Person"], [1292, 1298, "Person"], [1352, 1357, "Person"], [1364, 1373, "Time"], [1554, 1560, "Person"], [2192, 2195, "Person"], [1587, 1607, "Organization"], [2107, 2117, "Organization"], [2118, 2127, "Time"], [2129, 2135, "Person"], [2186, 2191, "Person"]]}
{"id": 157, "text": "North Korea has threatened to renege on commitments made to the United States on denuclearization, accusing the Trump administration of breaching the \"spirit\" of the negotiations by planning joint military exercises with South Korea. North Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the military drills were a \"rehearsal for war\" and broke promises US President Donald Trump made when he met Kim Jong Un at a summit in Singapore in June 2018.  \"With the US unilaterally reneging on its commitments, we are gradually losing our justifications to follow through on the commitments we made with the US as well,\" the statement said. \"It is crystal clear that it is an actual drill and a rehearsal of war aimed at militarily occupying our Republic by surprise attack and rapid dispatch of large-scale reinforcements,\" it said. \"The suspension of joint military exercises is what President Trump, Commander-in-Chief of the US, personally committed to at the DPRK-US summit talks in Singapore under the eyes of the whole world.\" \"Our discontinuation of the nuclear and ICBM tests and the US suspension of joint military exercises are, to all its intents and purposes, commitments made to improve bilateral relations. They are not a legal document inscribed on a paper.\"  North Korea said in May it had tested \"long-range multiple rocket launchers and tactical guided weapons,\" but it has not tested a nuclear weapon since 2017. The Pentagon confirmed the joint exercises Tuesday and said they would take place this fall.  The \"Republic of Korea (ROK) and US military forces are preparing to conduct a combined training program this fall. Working with the ROK, this training program has been adjusted to maintain readiness and support diplomatic efforts,\" Lt. Col. Dave Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, told CNN.  \"This routine combined training demonstrates the United States' commitment to the ROK-US alliance and defense of the Korean peninsula through activities that enhance combined readiness.\" The US and South Korea regularly conduct joint military drills, but suspended or scaled back a number of recent exercises part of an effort to ease tensions with Pyongyang. Tuesday's warning, made just weeks after Trump became the first sitting US President to set foot in North Korea, threatens to sink the President's latest attempts to negotiate with Kim. Trump has made the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula a central aim of his foreign policy, but those efforts have stalled in recent months and appeared on the brink of breakdown when the President walked out of a second summit with Kim in February. He said last month that the pair agreed to restart talks. Since then, Trump has said he is in \"no rush\" to reach an agreement with Kim, but the North Korean leader said in a policy speech in April that he will give the US until the end of the year to show more flexibility in the nuclear talks. \"I think they would like to make a deal and we would like to make a deal,\" Trump said last month.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 11, "Organization"], [60, 77, "Organization"], [112, 117, "Person"], [221, 232, "Organization"], [234, 264, "Organization"], [285, 292, "Time"], [364, 366, "Organization"], [377, 389, "Person"], [407, 418, "Person"], [434, 443, "Location"], [444, 456, "Organization"], [465, 471, "Organization"], [607, 613, "Organization"], [899, 904, "Person"], [967, 971, "Organization"], [972, 974, "Organization"], [991, 1000, "Location"], [1092, 1098, "Organization"], [1279, 1290, "Organization"], [1296, 1302, "Time"], [1424, 1434, "Time"], [1436, 1448, "Organization"], [1479, 1486, "Time"], [1530, 1552, "Organization"], [1554, 1557, "Organization"], [1563, 1581, "Organization"], [1659, 1666, "Organization"], [1772, 1785, "Person"], [1789, 1798, "Organization"], [1814, 1817, "Organization"], [1865, 1882, "Organization"], [1898, 1905, "Organization"], [1906, 1908, "Organization"], [1932, 1953, "Location"], [2169, 2178, "Organization"], [2180, 2187, "Time"], [2018, 2029, "Organization"], [2007, 2013, "Organization"], [2221, 2226, "Person"], [2280, 2291, "Organization"], [2361, 2364, "Person"], [2366, 2371, "Person"], [2405, 2425, "Location"], [2604, 2607, "Person"], [2608, 2619, "Time"], [2691, 2697, "Person"], [2752, 2755, "Person"], [2761, 2777, "Organization"], [2809, 2817, "Time"], [2836, 2842, "Organization"], [2843, 2868, "Time"], [2991, 2996, "Person"]]}
{"id": 161, "text": "Political activist Gloria Steinem was in high school when the Korean War started. Now 85, she is urging politicians to bring it to an end. In 1950, North Korea invaded the South and war broke out between the two countries and China, the Soviet Union and the United States. Although an armistice was signed in 1953 stopping hostilities, the war never officially ended. As it was in 1953, a formal peace agreement today would need buy in from the US and China. On Friday, feminist icon Steinem spoke outside the US Embassy in Seoul, urging the US to agree to finally end the war -- and include women in the peace process. She'll also attend a peace forum at the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea on Thursday. \"If it didn't affect women and only affected men, I would be against war anyway,\" Steinem, a leading figure of the women's liberation movement, told CNN in an interview Friday. \"But it's especially important for us to speak because we don't have decision making power in going to war, and yet we're affected by war.\"  She's not for a \"competition of tears\" but says that she thinks women have been more affected by the ongoing war. According to the United Nations, there is evidence that women's participation in peace processes contributes to longer, more resilient peace after the conflict ends. \"It's not that there aren't militaristic women -- there are. It's not that there aren't peaceful men -- there are, there's nothing biological about it. Because of the phoney gender roles, I think women don't have masculinity to prove, so statistically speaking it's more likely we'll be able to make a lasting peace,\" Steinem said. CNN reached out to the US Embassy in Seoul for comment on Steinem's visit. Steinem and the Korean War Steinem said the war had a dramatic impact on her life as a young person. She remembers it as a \"cataclysmic event,\" when it felt like World War II would happen again. A classmate who was drafted into the Korean War was killed by his father in a murder-suicide, as the father -- a World War II veteran -- didn't want his son to go to war, she said.  In 2015, Steinem and a group of 30 female activists caused controversy by crossing the border in a bid to draw attention to the need for peace between North and South Korea, and demonstrate how artificial the divide between the two countries is. At the time, they called for women to be involved in the peace-building process and for families divided by the war to be united. But human rights activists said the group were ignoring the suffering faced by North Korean people, especially women. On Friday, Steinem said she was never uncritical of the North Korean leadership which is known for imposing repressive conditions on its people. Instead, she believes it is better to communicate with North Korea rather than leave it isolated. \"We marched to show the world that this conflict no longer needs to separate families, provide excuses for nuclear weapons, and an ongoing expensive US military commitment,\" Steinem said in her speech. \"We wanted to show the world with our bodies that this border is penetrable and arbitrary. With political will, it is a wound that can be healed.\" Christine Ahn -- an activist who organized the 2015 DMZ crossing -- agreed, saying that isolating and not engaging with North Korea had only made conditions worse in the country. Christine is one of the four leaders of the Korea Peace Now campaign, a group which partially funded Steinem's trip to the DMZ. Critics have previously accused Ahn of being too sympathetic to North Korea, an accusation she denies.   Changing politics There have been some signs recently that the Korean War could come to an end. Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula once and for all. Although both the US and China would need to agree to officially end the war, experts say there is nothing to stop the two Koreas from signing a bilateral peace treaty. This year, Donald Trump made history by becoming the first sitting US president to set foot on North Korean soil.  Korea was under Japanese rule before and during World War II. After Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union took the role of protecting the north, while the United States did the same for the south. In 1948, two ideologically opposite countries were established: The Republic of Korea, or South Korea, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea. While South Korea became a developed country, North Korea closed itself off, and many of its citizens continue to live in poverty.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[19, 33, "Person"], [139, 146, "Time"], [148, 159, "Organization"], [168, 177, "Organization"], [226, 231, "Organization"], [233, 249, "Organization"], [254, 271, "Organization"], [306, 313, "Time"], [378, 385, "Time"], [441, 447, "Organization"], [452, 457, "Organization"], [459, 468, "Time"], [484, 491, "Person"], [506, 520, "Organization"], [524, 529, "Location"], [538, 544, "Organization"], [656, 678, "Location"], [687, 708, "Organization"], [709, 720, "Time"], [804, 811, "Person"], [871, 875, "Organization"], [891, 897, "Time"], [1167, 1185, "Organization"], [1638, 1645, "Person"], [1652, 1655, "Organization"], [1671, 1685, "Organization"], [1689, 1694, "Location"], [1710, 1717, "Person"], [1727, 1734, "Person"], [1754, 1761, "Person"], [2104, 2111, "Time"], [2113, 2120, "Person"], [2255, 2276, "Organization"], [2559, 2571, "Location"], [2598, 2607, "Time"], [2609, 2616, "Person"], [2650, 2666, "Organization"], [2798, 2809, "Organization"], [2990, 3001, "Organization"], [3015, 3022, "Person"], [3190, 3203, "Person"], [3237, 3242, "Time"], [3310, 3321, "Organization"], [3369, 3378, "Person"], [3409, 3437, "Organization"], [3470, 3477, "Person"], [3561, 3572, "Organization"], [3698, 3707, "Time"], [3709, 3721, "Organization"], [3729, 3740, "Person"], [3745, 3757, "Organization"], [3768, 3779, "Person"], [3804, 3824, "Location"], [3857, 3864, "Organization"], [3868, 3873, "Organization"], [3958, 3972, "Organization"], [4023, 4035, "Person"], [4107, 4119, "Location"], [4127, 4132, "Organization"], [4143, 4151, "Organization"], [4195, 4200, "Organization"], [4214, 4230, "Organization"], [4276, 4293, "Organization"], [4322, 4329, "Time"], [4386, 4407, "Organization"], [4412, 4423, "Organization"], [4429, 4470, "Organization"], [4475, 4486, "Organization"], [4494, 4505, "Organization"], [4534, 4545, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 162, "text": "North Korea has made its second launch of projectiles this week, a senior US official tells CNN. The official said US military intelligence tracked a new launch from North Korea on Friday morning local time (Thursday in the US). According to the initial assessment, the projectile appeared to be similar to the short range ballistic missiles fired earlier this week, the official said, referring to Wednesday's twin launches from North Korea's east coast.  A second US official told CNN that the initial assessment was that North Korea launched two short range ballistic missiles.  South Korea's military has been monitoring North Korean activity and confirmed the launch of two \"unidentified short-range projectiles\" from North Korea's South Hamgyong Province toward the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.  The projectiles were launched at 2:59 a.m. and 3:23 a.m. local time, the statement said. The timing of the tests coincides with a series of ASEAN meetings held this week in the Thai capital of Bangkok, where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in attendance. US president Donald Trump said Thursday he had \"no problem\" with the launches. Asked for his reaction to North Korean ballistic missile testing, he responded: \"Short range missiles. We never made an agreement on that. I have no problem.\" \"These are short-range missiles, they're very standard,\" he said.

{"id": 163, "text": "North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast Wednesday, South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) said in a statement, the second such launch in less than a week.  The missiles were launched from the Wonsan-Kalma area just after 5 a.m. local time and 5:27 a.m. (4:27 p.m. ET) on Wednesday, and traveled an estimated distance of 250 kilometers (155 miles) and height of 30 kilometers (18 miles), according to South Korean officials. A US official also confirmed the missile launches to CNN, adding that they had posed no threat to the US or its allies, and fell into the sea.  But South Korea's JCS warned in a statement that North Korea's repeated missile launches did \"not aid in efforts to ease the tension on the Korean Peninsula.\"  \"We call for cessation of these actions,\" the statement added.  The Blue House, the South Korean presidential office, said in a statement Wednesday that officials had held an emergency National Security Council meeting this morning.  The next day, North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency KCNA reported that leader Kim Jong Un had \"guided\" the launch, describing it as a test fire of a \"newly-developed large-caliber multiple launch guided rocket system.\" The launch timing coincides with a series of ASEAN meetings being held in the Thai capital Bangkok, which some of the world's top diplomats will attend. It also comes after North Korean officials last week indicated to the White House that working level talks could start soon, a senior administration official said Tuesday.   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters, on board his flight to Bangkok, that he didn't know when talks with North Korea would restart but that he was hopeful it wouldn't be \"too long.\" On June 30, US President Donald Trump met Kim at the Korean Demilitarized Zone -- the heavily militarized border between North and South Korea. He made history by stepping over the demarcation line, becoming the first sitting US President to set foot on North Korean soil.  Though Trump and Kim agreed to resume working-level negotiations after their meeting, the two sides have not publicly announced any scheduled talks. \"Chairman Kim said when the two leaders met at the DMZ that they would start in a few weeks. It's taking a little bit longer than that, there's been a little bit of preliminary work to be done but I hope ... before too long we'll have special representative (Stephen) Biegun sitting with what I think will be his new counterpart for North Korea,\" Pompeo said Wednesday.  Three launches in three months Wednesday's launch was North Korea's third in as many months. In May, a short-range missile launch appeared to signal Kim's frustration at deadlocked talks with the US. On July 25, North Korea sent two new short-range ballistic missiles toward the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan. According to North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the July 25 twin launches were intended to send a warning to South Korea and had been \"personally organized\" by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The launches might have been North Korea's response to planned joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, analysts said. The exercises have long been an aggravation for North Korea, which has called them a \"rehearsal for war.\" Experts say the Kim regime is also concerned by South Korea's decision to acquire F-35 stealth fighters, which could be capable of evading North Korean radars. South Korea's Defense Ministry announced on July 16 that two F-35A stealth fighters had arrived in the country from the US. Seoul currently has four F-35s but plans to acquire 40 by 2021.  KCNA reported Friday that Kim considered South Korea's military maneuvers to be \"suicidal\" acts that could torpedo the recent diplomatic progress between the two sides. He also cautioned President Moon Jae-in to heed \"the warning from Pyongyang.\" South Korea said then that it viewed the launches as a \"military threat\" designed to undermine progress toward stability on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's National Security Council's standing committee concluded the launches had involved \"a new type of short-range ballistic missile,\" suggesting that the isolated country has been actively developing its military capabilities.  It is not clear if Wednesday's launch involved the new type of missile.  The Kim regime said North Korea would stop testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles during negotiations with Washington, but has not given any assurances regarding other weapons. Still, the tests are a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which bar North Korea from testing and launching ballistic missiles.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 11, "Organization"], [75, 84, "Time"], [86, 120, "Organization"], [122, 125, "Organization"], [229, 246, "Location"], [258, 275, "Time"], [280, 289, "Time"], [290, 303, "Time"], [305, 317, "Time"], [437, 449, "Organization"], [463, 465, "Organization"], [514, 517, "Location"], [559, 565, "Organization"], [609, 620, "Organization"], [623, 626, "Organization"], [654, 665, "Organization"], [741, 761, "Location"], [829, 843, "Organization"], [845, 881, "Organization"], [903, 912, "Time"], [950, 975, "Organization"], [984, 996, "Time"], [999, 1011, "Time"], [1013, 1024, "Organization"], [1037, 1063, "Organization"], [1064, 1068, "Organization"], [1090, 1102, "Person"], [1276, 1281, "Organization"], [1305, 1321, "Location"], [1322, 1329, "Location"], [1404, 1416, "Organization"], [1427, 1436, "Time"], [1450, 1465, "Organization"], [1547, 1554, "Time"], [1580, 1591, "Person"], [1631, 1638, "Location"], [1676, 1687, "Organization"], [1753, 1763, "Time"], [1765, 1768, "Organization"], [1778, 1790, "Person"], [1795, 1798, "Person"], [1802, 1831, "Location"], [1874, 1895, "Location"], [1979, 1981, "Organization"], [2007, 2019, "Organization"], [2034, 2039, "Person"], [2044, 2047, "Person"], [2186, 2189, "Person"], [2435, 2442, "Person"], [2444, 2450, "Person"], [2509, 2520, "Organization"], [2523, 2529, "Person"], [2535, 2544, "Time"], [2578, 2587, "Time"], [2601, 2612, "Organization"], [2640, 2646, "Time"], [2696, 2699, "Person"], [2739, 2745, "Person"], [2747, 2757, "Time"], [2759, 2770, "Organization"], [2822, 2834, "Location"], [2850, 2866, "Location"], [2881, 2892, "Organization"], [2905, 2931, "Organization"], [2933, 2937, "Organization"], [2944, 2951, "Time"], [3001, 3012, "Organization"], [3052, 3064, "Organization"], [3072, 3083, "Person"], [3114, 3125, "Organization"], [3181, 3187, "Organization"], [3192, 3203, "Organization"], [3268, 3279, "Organization"], [3342, 3345, "Person"], [3374, 3385, "Organization"], [3465, 3477, "Organization"], [3486, 3516, "Organization"], [3527, 3537, "Time"], [3665, 3672, "Time"], [3675, 3679, "Organization"], [3689, 3695, "Time"], [3701, 3704, "Person"], [3716, 3727, "Organization"], [3872, 3883, "Person"], [3910, 3919, "Organization"], [3922, 3933, "Organization"], [4046, 4066, "Location"], [4068, 4107, "Organization"], [4325, 4334, "Time"], [4383, 4386, "Person"], [4399, 4410, "Organization"], [4511, 4521, "Organization"], [4617, 4648, "Organization"], [4672, 4683, "Organization"]]}

{"id": 170, "text": "North Korean state media released images Tuesday of leader Kim Jong Un inspecting what appeared to be a submarine under construction. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Kim was briefed about the submarine's operational and tactical data and combat weapon systems.  Kim expressed \"great satisfaction\" and \"stressed the need to steadily and reliably increase the national defense capability, by directing big efforts to the development of naval weapons and equipment, such as submarines,\" KCNA reported.  He added that the sub would be deployed to North Korea's territorial waters to the east of the country \"soon.\"  Three photographs released by KCNA showed Kim, in a gray suit, standing besides the hulking vessel inside a nondescript warehouse. Analysts said the Kim regime has sought to build a viable nuclear-armed submarine to enhance its deterrence capabilities, as the vessels are hard for adversaries to track and destroy. The regime successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) in 2016. Though Pyongyang is believed to boast a fleet of about 70 submarines, experts say most of them are likely old, loud and unable to fire nuclear-armed ballsitic missiles.  The United States assessed that the photos likely show a refurbished submarine that Washington has been aware of for more than a year, according to a senior US official with direct knowledge of the assessment. Dave Schmerler, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the images suggested that the sub under construction is much larger than the one used in 2016.   \"If this submarine is built for carrying and launching SLBMs it is more than likely that they would test it, to ensure that it works the way they would need it to,\" Schmerler said.  But it's unclear exactly how far along the newly-pictured submarine is, said Melissa Hanham, the deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.  \"The submarine is still up in a warehouse, it hasn't been put into the dry docks, it doesn't appear to be finished yet,\" said Hanham. Hanham said the images do not reveal the top of the submarine. \"That's where the missiles go, that's what I want to see,\" she said.  The one photograph released that shows a large portion of the sub appears to have been intentionally cropped at the top. Hanham said it's possible Pyongyang released images of Kim visiting a secretive military operation for political reasons, or to send a message to the United States. \"What makes it seem like signaling is they're actually producing photographs, very carefully curated photographs that don't give us as much information as we would hope to glean,\" she said.  Kim and US President Donald Trump agreed to resume denuclearization talks between the two sides last month, but it's unclear how far things have moved since then.  Last week, North Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a strongly worded statement chastising the US and South Korea for its plans to go ahead with joint military exercises in South Korea, calling them a \"rehearsal of war. Seoul and Washington agreed to end the large-scale drills and replace them with smaller drills, often with more computer simulation, as a way to help complement diplomacy. North Korea said Trump committed to suspending joint military exercises during his first meeting with Kim in Singapore, and hinted that it could renege on its decision to stop testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles should the drills go ahead.  Pyongyang has made no firm commitments to stop testing shorter range or submarine launched missiles.  \"Our discontinuation of the nuclear and ICBM tests and the US suspension of joint military exercises are, to all its intents and purposes, commitments made to improve bilateral relations.

{"id": 176, "text": "With 20 steps over the military demarcation line at the Korean Demilitarized Zone Sunday, US President Donald Trump made history.  Trump became the first sitting US President to set foot on North Korean soil -- a milestone Trump repeatedly touted in the hours that followed -- and later in a triumphant tweet before departing South Korea on Air Force One, calling the occasion \"a great honor.\" Those 20 steps were, indeed, a remarkable achievement. The fact that US officials and the notoriously rigid North Korean bureaucracy were able to pull together such a momentous meeting in around 24 hours, after Trump proposed the idea on Twitter, is a testament to the warm personal relationship that has developed over the last year between the two leaders.  It is also highly significant that the two were able to go beyond a simple two-minute handshake previewed earlier by the US President, and speak privately for nearly an hour -- announcing they would form teams with the goal of resuming working level denuclearization talks by mid July. But as the buzz wears off from a dizzying day of impromptu diplomacy, a far longer and more difficult march lies ahead to achieve the ultimate goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Denuclearization It was noteworthy that Trump never once mentioned the word denuclearization on Sunday.  If the last year of stalled diplomacy with Pyongyang has proven anything, it's that negotiations over North Korea's prized nuclear arsenal are fraught with complexities and, at times, seemingly insurmountable difficulties. My 19 trips to North Korea have shown me it is a country unique in the world, with a vastly different worldview than anywhere else. Dealing with a country like this requires an equally unique approach.  It may be difficult for outsiders to understand why this isolated Northeast Asian nation clings to an arsenal that has cost it dearly in terms of severe economic sanctions and isolation from much of the global community.  From the North Korean regime's viewpoint, nuclear weapons guarantee their survival as a sovereign state and provide legitimacy for leader Kim Jong Un. Kim spent his first years in power growing his arsenal at breakneck speed, spending much of 2016 and 2017 launching ballistic missiles and testing nuclear weapons at a disturbing pace. North Korea's last nuclear test in September, 2017, was so powerful it triggered a 6.3 magnitude earthquake and literally moved a mountain at it's now-shuttered Punggye-ri nuclear test site.  The world's attention Kim's defiant and militaristic behavior got the world's attention. North Korean officials in Pyongyang repeatedly told me that Kim's ultimate goal was never to unleash the horrific weapons he created, but to use them to gain leverage and come to the negotiating table from a position of strength.  Arguably, Kim has accomplished that goal in spades. His diplomatic detente with Trump has led to meetings with some of the worlds most powerful leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also met repeatedly with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has staked much of his political capital on keeping diplomacy with the north alive, despite numerous setbacks -- including the collapse of February talks between Trump and Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, and subsequent bellicose rhetoric and the resumption of short range ballistic missile testing by the North Koreans. Buys Kim time Kim has so far been unable to achieve his ultimate goal of relief from crushing sanctions. Sources told me earlier this year he was bewildered by the disappointing outcome of the Hanoi Summit, going so far as to dole out severe punishments for key members of his negotiating team in an effort to save face.  The US has also failed to achieve its ultimate goal of getting North Korea to relinquish any of its nuclear weapons, or even agree upon a definition of denuclearization.  Despite the theatrics of Sundays historic day at the DMZ, those tremendous challenges remain. Both  Kim and Trump seem to be banking on their personal relationship as the solution that will help them overcome the huge divide that remains between the US and North Korea.  If anything, Sunday's meeting buys Kim time to prove to skeptics inside his country that he is capable of striking a deal with the US, despite the breakdown of talks in Hanoi.

{"id": 178, "text": "Hopes for a third summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump appeared to be revived Wednesday even after Pyongyang rebuked Washington over \"hostility\" that \"viciously slandered\" the country. The North Korean Foreign Ministry accused the US of engaging in \"extreme hostile acts\" against their country, specifically calling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but sparing Trump from their criticism. Yet just hours after the statement published, South Korean President Moon Jae-in revealed that the long-time adversaries had been talking \"behind the scenes\" and \"engaged in dialogue in regard to a third summit.\" \"There's no reason to regard the current situation as a stalemate in the peace process on the peninsula just because the pace has remained slow,\" Moon said in a written question-and-answer session with several media outlets.  \"Complete denuclearization and a permanent peace regime on the peninsula are tasks that cannot be achieved overnight.\" Denuclearization talks between North Korea and the US had appeared stalled since the last summit between Trump and Kim ended abruptly in Hanoi without a deal in February.   A recent exchange of letters between the two leaders had revived hope of a breakthrough. Trump is scheduled to travel to Osaka, Japan, for the G20 summit from Friday, before going to South Korea to meet with Moon. He is reportedly considering a visit to the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas, a South Korean government official said. Reckless remarks The North Korean Foreign Ministry statement stopped short of accusing Trump of wrongdoing. It even referred to him as the \"supreme leader\" of the United States, the same title by which Kim is referred to in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as North Korea is officially known.  It came days after Kim said he received an \"excellent\" personal letter from Trump. It followed one that Kim sent to Trump, which the US President described as \"beautiful.\"    Analysts had hoped the exchange could get denuclearization talks back on track. But the North Korean statement appeared to distinguish \"their bromance from the relationship between their two countries,\" said Duyeon Kim, an analyst at the Center for a New American Security. \"It sounds like they're sending a warning to Washington, almost as if to manage expectations ahead of a third summit, while making an appeal to Trump to basically put a straight jacket on his staff.\" The North Korean statement accused Pompeo of making a \"reckless remark\" when he said it was the fact that 80% of North Korea's economy was under sanctions that had brought the country to the table.   \"Our state is not a country that will surrender to the US sanctions, nor are we a country which the US could attack whenever it desires to do so,\" the ministry spokesperson said. \"If anyone dares to trample over our sovereignty and the right to existence, we will not hesitate to pull a muscle-flexing trigger in order to defend ourselves.\" Foreign Ministry statements published in KCNA are considered more authoritative than commentaries or opinion pieces authored by those outside the ministry or the higher echelons of the ruling Worker's Party.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[33, 45, "Organization"], [53, 64, "Person"], [69, 71, "Organization"], [82, 94, "Person"], [118, 127, "Time"], [139, 148, "Location"], [157, 167, "Organization"], [225, 258, "Organization"], [267, 273, "Organization"], [379, 390, "Person"], [403, 408, "Person"], [500, 511, "Person"], [477, 489, "Organization"], [1020, 1031, "Organization"], [1036, 1042, "Organization"], [1094, 1099, "Person"], [1104, 1107, "Person"], [1126, 1131, "Location"], [1147, 1158, "Time"], [1251, 1256, "Person"], [1283, 1288, "Location"], [1290, 1295, "Location"], [1321, 1327, "Time"], [1345, 1356, "Time"], [1370, 1374, "Person"], [1452, 1466, "Time"], [1470, 1493, "Organization"], [1526, 1559, "Organization"], [1596, 1601, "Person"], [1668, 1685, "Organization"], [1711, 1714, "Person"], [1733, 1774, "Organization"], [1779, 1790, "Organization"], [1832, 1835, "Person"], [1889, 1894, "Person"], [1917, 1920, "Person"], [1929, 1934, "Person"], [1942, 1948, "Organization"], [2072, 2088, "Organization"], [2196, 2206, "Person"], [2222, 2260, "Organization"], [2307, 2317, "Organization"], [2406, 2411, "Person"], [2462, 2478, "Organization"], [2497, 2503, "Person"], [2575, 2586, "Organization"], [2713, 2719, "Organization"], [2758, 2764, "Organization"], [3044, 3048, "Organization"], [3003, 3019, "Organization"], [3195, 3209, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 179, "text": "Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un attended an elaborate celebration in Pyongyang Thursday celebrating 70 years of diplomatic relations between China and North Korea, underscoring their alliance amid challenges posed by the United States.  Fireworks burst into the sky over the May 1 stadium in the North Korean capital, while enormous signs proclaimed that the two countries were \"true and reliable comrades.\" \"Long live the unbreakable friendship and union between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Chinese people,\" one banner said. In one image, composed of hundreds of people holding up cards, rainbows linked the Forbidden City in Beijing and the Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, while both leaders looked on with broad smiles.  The performance was described as a display of \"undefeatable socialism\" in North Korean state broadcaster KCNA. In the evening, state media said both leaders held a \"warm\" banquet where each toasted the other and expressed their hopes for a \"beautiful future\" for relations between the two countries. President Xi returned to China Friday afternoon, according to state media. His visit was the first by a Chinese leader in 14 years.  His two day state visit to North Korea comes just one week before Xi is expected to fly to the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where he will meet for bilateral talks with US President Donald Trump. It remains to be seen whether they can break the deadlock in trade negotiations between the two countries after talks broke down unexpectedly at the beginning of May. In response, the Trump administration increased tariffs to 25% on an estimated $200 billion of Chinese imports. North Korea's diplomatic relationship with the US has been chilly as well since February when Trump walked out of nuclear disarmament talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, with Kim Jong Un. No further negotiations around the surrender of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal are planned at this time. But some analysts said that the two-day trip by Xi could indicate some movement on the stalled US talks, saying China is keen to showcase its potential contribution to improving relations between the two countries. \"If China's mediation can prove helpful, it would also help demonstrate the usefulness of China to the United States as a constructive partner over key regional issues,\" said Tong Zhao, a fellow at the Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. China's state broadcaster CCTV quoted Kim as saying 250,000 people welcomed the Chinese leader in the streets of the North Korean capital Thursday. Both Xi and Kim held bilateral talks on Thursday although only Chinese state media addressed the ongoing tensions with Washington.  According to China's Xinhua, Xi told Kim that \"the international community\" was hoping for further successful talks between North Korea and the US on denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. Xi previously visited Pyongyang in 2008, when he was China's vice president and when Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, ruled North Korea.  His trip Thursday was the first visit of a Chinese leader to North Korean since 2005, a time period marred by mutual mistrust and, at times, outright loathing between the two countries. CCTV previously reported at the start of the trip that Xi said the relationship between China and North Korea is a \"strategic choice made by both sides and won't be shaken no matter how the international situation changes.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 10, "Person"], [15, 26, "Person"], [64, 74, "Location"], [74, 82, "Time"], [136, 141, "Organization"], [146, 157, "Organization"], [212, 229, "Organization"], [287, 311, "Location"], [266, 275, "Time"], [459, 500, "Organization"], [502, 506, "Organization"], [651, 658, "Location"], [686, 695, "Location"], [820, 850, "Organization"], [851, 855, "Organization"], [1056, 1058, "Person"], [1077, 1093, "Time"], [1206, 1217, "Organization"], [1245, 1247, "Person"], [1288, 1293, "Location"], [1295, 1300, "Location"], [1359, 1371, "Person"], [1346, 1348, "Organization"], [1557, 1562, "Person"], [1652, 1663, "Organization"], [1695, 1701, "Organization"], [1726, 1740, "Time"], [1746, 1751, "Person"], [1795, 1800, "Location"], [1802, 1809, "Location"], [1815, 1827, "Person"], [1877, 1886, "Organization"], [1979, 1981, "Person"], [2043, 2048, "Organization"], [2150, 2155, "Organization"], [2236, 2241, "Organization"], [2245, 2262, "Organization"], [2321, 2330, "Person"], [2344, 2404, "Location"], [2406, 2411, "Organization"], [2444, 2447, "Person"], [2486, 2493, "Organization"], [2519, 2543, "Location"], [2544, 2552, "Time"], [2559, 2561, "Person"], [2566, 2569, "Person"], [2591, 2602, "Time"], [2673, 2683, "Organization"], [2699, 2704, "Location"], [2707, 2713, "Organization"], [2715, 2717, "Person"], [2723, 2726, "Person"], [2810, 2821, "Organization"], [2826, 2832, "Organization"], [2856, 2876, "Time"], [2878, 2880, "Person"], [2900, 2909, "Location"], [2910, 2917, "Time"], [2931, 2936, "Organization"], [2963, 2974, "Person"], [2985, 2996, "Person"], [3004, 3015, "Organization"], [3027, 3035, "Time"], [3061, 3068, "Organization"], [3079, 3091, "Organization"], [3092, 3102, "Time"], [3259, 3261, "Person"], [3292, 3297, "Organization"], [3302, 3313, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 184, "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive in North Korea on Thursday for a two-day state visit, his first official trip to the country since he came to power in 2012.  Xi is making the trip \"at the invitation\" of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xinhua reported Monday. North Korean state media also confirmed the visit.  The meeting takes place a week before G20 summit in Japan, where Xi is expected to meet with US President Donald Trump, and comes as nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States have stalled.  Relations between the two countries had been in a deep chill under the North Korean leader until recently, but an unexpected visit by Kim to China in March 2018 signaled the beginning of a new era of Beijing-Pyongyang relations.  In the preceding years, Kim had purged several key officials with close ties to Beijing, including his uncle Jang Song Thaek. He had also angered China through his provocative missile and nuclear testing, which went against Beijing's goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. However since that visit early last year, Xi and Kim have met four times, with China even lending the young North Korean leader a plane to attend a June 2018 summit with Trump in Singapore. The Chinese President was originally rumored to be planning a visit to Pyongyang that same month, but the trip never materialized.  This week's state visit will make Xi the first Chinese leader to visit North Korea since his predecessor, Hu Jintao visited in 2005. China is North Korea's number one trading and economic partner, and is Pyongyang's only major military ally. South Korea hopeful that Xi's visit helps denuclearization South Korea said Monday that it hopes Xi's visit to North Korea would aid efforts towards denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula. In a written statement, the country's Presidential Blue House spokesman said the government had been aware of Xi's intention to visit North Korea since last week.  Seoul had been closely cooperating with the Chinese government \"in the belief that President Xi Jinping's visit will contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Korean peninsula's issues,\" the spokesman added. South Korea and China have agreed to hold bilateral talks at the G20 next week and the specifics of the meeting are still being discussed.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[18, 28, "Person"], [44, 55, "Location"], [56, 67, "Time"], [157, 164, "Time"], [167, 169, "Person"], [212, 224, "Organization"], [232, 243, "Person"], [245, 251, "Organization"], [261, 267, "Time"], [269, 281, "Location"], [359, 362, "Organization"], [373, 378, "Location"], [386, 388, "Person"], [427, 439, "Person"], [483, 494, "Organization"], [499, 516, "Organization"], [603, 615, "Organization"], [666, 669, "Person"], [673, 678, "Location"], [679, 692, "Time"], [732, 739, "Organization"], [740, 749, "Organization"], [786, 789, "Person"], [842, 849, "Organization"], [871, 886, "Person"], [908, 913, "Organization"], [986, 993, "Organization"], [1020, 1036, "Location"], [1063, 1078, "Time"], [1080, 1082, "Person"], [1087, 1090, "Person"], [1117, 1122, "Organization"], [1146, 1158, "Organization"], [1186, 1195, "Time"], [1208, 1213, "Person"], [1217, 1226, "Location"], [1232, 1239, "Organization"], [1299, 1308, "Location"], [1394, 1396, "Person"], [1407, 1414, "Organization"], [1431, 1442, "Location"], [1466, 1475, "Person"], [1484, 1491, "Time"], [1493, 1498, "Organization"], [1502, 1513, "Organization"], [1564, 1573, "Organization"], [1602, 1613, "Organization"], [1627, 1629, "Person"], [1661, 1672, "Location"], [1678, 1684, "Time"], [1699, 1701, "Person"], [1713, 1724, "Location"], [1781, 1801, "Location"], [1854, 1864, "Organization"], [1913, 1915, "Person"], [1937, 1948, "Location"], [1955, 1964, "Time"], [1967, 1972, "Organization"], [2011, 2018, "Organization"], [2060, 2070, "Person"], [2125, 2145, "Location"], [2178, 2189, "Organization"], [2194, 2199, "Organization"], [2243, 2246, "Organization"], [2247, 2256, "Time"]]}
{"id": 185, "text": "The younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Korea's demilitarized zone on Wednesday to pay her respects to South Korea's former first lady, who died earlier this week. Kim Yo Jong traveled to the border village of Panmunjom to deliver a wreath of flowers and her brother's condolences to senior South Korean officials. Kim -- who is also a senior official in North Korea -- told the delegation that her brother considered the late first lady Lee Hee-ho \"dear to his heart,\" according to a South Korean presidential official. Lee was the wife of late South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who ruled the country from 1998 to 2003.  In 2000 he became the first South Korean leader to meet North Korea's then-Chairman Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father. Kim Dae-jung's \"sunshine policy\" towards North Korea -- so-called for its warmth and friendliness -- earned him a Nobel Peace  Prize in 2000. On Wednesday, South Korea's Director of National Security, Chung Eui-yong, expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of his country's President Moon Jae-in for \"the respectful and special message along with the flowers from Chairman Kim.\" He also said he hoped that the former first lady's passing can serve as a moment to \"renew our promise to work toward a peaceful and prosperous future for Korean people.\" The meeting comes at delicate time in relations between the two countries, which are still technically at war since the 1953 Armistice Agreement only formalized a ceasefire. A much-anticipated summit between Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in Singapore last year had raised hopes of nuclear disarmament by the North Korea leader.  But these failed to materialize and in the past year the rhetoric between North Korea and the US -- a key ally of South Korea -- has become increasingly frosty, with the collapse of another Trump-Kim summit, slated to be held in Vietnam earlier this year.

{"id": 186, "text": "The North Korean diplomat who South Korea's largest newspaper said had been executed by firing squad is alive and in state custody, according to several sources familiar with the situation.  North Korea's special envoy to the United States, Kim Hyok Chol, is being investigated for his role in the failed Hanoi summit that took place between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February, the sources said. That meeting, the second between the two leaders, ended abruptly without the two sides reaching a deal. Kim Jong Un's translator in Hanoi, Sin Hye Yong, also is in custody and under investigation, sources said. South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported Friday that Kim Yong Chol, one of North Korea's most senior officials who had sat in the White House across from President Trump for talks little more than a year ago, had been purged and that Kim Hyok Chol had been executed by firing squad as punishment for the lack of success in Hanoi. The story cited an anonymous source inside North Korea, and was not confirmed by the governments of North or South Korea. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said his country was looking into the reports, while South Korea's Presidential Blue House said it was not appropriate \"to make any hasty judgment or comment about that part.\"  At a news conference Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Minister, Kim Yeon-chul, declined to discuss either Chosun Ilbo or CNN's reporting on the whereabouts of the North Korean officials. The report's veracity was called into question Sunday after North Korean state media reported that Kim Yong Chol attended an art performance alongside Kim Jong Un. An invitation to join to join the North Korean leader in public would likely not be extended to someone who had fallen out of favor.  When asked about the Chosun Ilbo report, one of the sources who spoke to CNN said, \"the news was wrong.\" The sources said Kim Yong Chol had seen power \"almost deprived\" since the Hanoi summit, despite his public appearance alongside the North Korean leader over the weekend. The sources add Kim, who previously served as North Korea's spy chief, was not sentenced to forced labor, but instead \"kept silently in his office writing statements of self-criticism.\" Trotting him out publicly was a signal to Washington that the North Korean leader was \"not breaking off negotiations over denuclearization,\" despite escalating tensions in recent weeks, one source said. North Korea test-fired short-range ballistic missiles last month, worrying many of the country's neighbors. They were the first tests of their kind since 2017. The fate of Kim Hyok Chol, the special envoy, had not been determined, but he could still face \"heavy punishment,\" one of the sources said. Kim Song Hye, a North Korean official on the team negotiating with the United States, is also in custody and under investigation, sources said.  The individuals who spoke to CNN requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about the situation. Chosun's story on the purported punishments for Kim Hyok Chol and Kim Yong Chol was widely circulated but met with heavy skepticism from experts due to its thin sourcing. If true, it would have amounted to a rapid downfall for two of North Korea's highest profile figures. Analysts had speculated that some of the North Korean diplomats overseeing the US negotiations in Hanoi were in hot water after the latest round of talks between the two countries ended abruptly in Vietnam without an agreement. Diplomats and officials from Pyongyang have been known to disappear from public view only to resurface after a period of so-called reeducation, analysts and former diplomats say. Kim Yong Ju, the brother of Kim Il Sung -- North Korea's founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un -- disappeared for nearly two decades. He disappeared in the mid 1970s and then reappeared in 1993.

{"id": 189, "text": "North Korean state media has launched a stinging attack on the former United States vice president and current presidential candidate, Joe Biden, mocking him as a \"fool of low IQ.\" The comments, published Wednesday, appear to closely mirror remarks made by US President Donald Trump and his supporters against the former vice president. In March, Trump called Biden \"another low IQ individual,\" while his attorney Rudy Giuliani described him as a \"mentally deficient idiot.\" North Korea's criticism of Biden comes in response to comments made by the former vice president in which he referred to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a \"dictator\" and a \"tyrant\" during a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday. North Korean state media, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), accused Biden of \"slandering rhetoric,\" and described him as \"reckless and senseless, seized by ambition for power.\" \"What he uttered is just sophism of an imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being, let alone a politician,\" the KCNA article said. It proceeded to list off a range of embarrassing moments for Biden, and recommended that he \"think back (on) the reason for his past two failures in presidential elections.\" \"Yet, he is self-praising himself as being the most popular presidential candidate. This is enough to make a cat laugh,\" the statement said. The comments are in sharp contrast to North Korea's seemingly positive view of the relationship between Kim and Trump. In April, state media described Kim as being pleased with Trump, despite the apparent failure of their last meeting in Vietnam in February. North Korea is known to change its tone depending on the state of relations.

{"id": 190, "text": "If the current war of words between Iran and the United States has strange echoes of 2017, it's because the same US strategy is at work.  The Trump administration is using its North Korea playbook on Iran: Use a \"maximum pressure\" campaign -- the same nomenclature was used for Tehran and Pyongyang -- to box the adversary into a corner, then try to negotiate. Respond to a threat by escalating your own threat. Then negotiate to alleviate tensions and claim a win. In North Korea's case, it was US President Donald Trump's now-infamous \"fire and fury\" ultimatum that kicked off the biggest tensions: \"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen... he has been very threatening beyond a normal state.\" The threat against Iran came in the form of a tweet Sunday: \"If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\" Van Jackson, a former official in the Defense Department under the Obama administration and author of \"On the Brink: Trump, Kim, and the threat of Nuclear War,\" told CNN that Trump \"took a gamble aiming big threats at North Korea, he paid no price for that so far, and so now he thinks he's a good gambler.\" \"Trump has no idea that the North Korean nuclear crisis was the closest America came to nuclear war since 1962. That ignorance is leading him to repeat many of the same impulsive mistakes that nearly brought catastrophe in 2017,\" added Jackson. Rhetorical whiplash On camera, Trump took a much less combative tone in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday. \"I just don't want them to have nuclear weapons, and they can't be threatening us,\" Trump said of Iran.  \"With all of everything that's going on, and I'm not one that believes -- you know, I'm not somebody that wants to go into war, because war hurts economies, war kills people most importantly -- by far most importantly.\"  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly denied Iran is building a bomb and says weapons of mass destruction are forbidden under Islam.  Answering the same question, Trump also pointed to North Korea as a diplomatic win. \"When I went to North Korea, there were nuclear tests all the time, there were missiles going up all the time, we had a very rough time and then we got along. We'll see what happens right now,\" Trump said. He continued: \"Right now, I don't think I told them when I left Vietnam, where we had the summit, I said to Chairman Kim, and I think very importantly, I said look, you're not ready for a deal, cause he wanted to get rid of one or two sites, but he has five sites. I said what about the other three sites? That's no good, (if) we're gonna make a deal, let's make a real deal. But they haven't had any tests over the last two years.\"  The problem is the jury's still out on whether Trump's North Korea strategy will ultimately bear fruit. Right now, it's not looking good. \"It seems very clear that at least the President's strategy is to ramp up the temperature with, and pressure on Iran, to get them to renegotiate the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal), which he believes was flawed because it allowed Iran to have a (clearly regionally aggressive) foreign policy and some remnants of a defense capability (i.e. missiles) and sunset clauses on enrichment caps,\" said MIT professor and nuclear proliferation expert Vipin Narang. Trump formally abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, to the dismay of both Iran and its European signatories in May, 2018.  \"It is dangerous to run the same play on Iran on the mistaken belief that it worked with North Korea, when the evidence is certainly mixed, if not outright contradictory,\" added Narang.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump left their February summit in Hanoi without a deal and clearly far apart on the parameters needed to seal one. Trump has openly pushed for an agreement with Kim in which both sides go all-in: North Korea fully dismantles its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs in exchange for full sanctions relief. Kim made clear that he's unhappy with how negotiations have proceeded since he and Trump failed to reach an agreement in Hanoi. In a speech to the ruling Worker's Party last month, Kim said he would want until the end of the year to \"see whether the United States makes a courageous decision or not.\"  \"Claiming a win on North Korea when the outcome has been anything but that is dangerous on two fronts: With North Korea because Kim is likely going to keep gradually escalating behavior that the US finds provocative, and with Iran because Trump seems to have internalized his own fact-free narrative about the magic he worked with North Korea,\" Jackson said.  To the chagrin of many in Washington, Pyongyang has resumed test-firing short-range ballistic missiles that could potentially carry nuclear warheads. Kim only agreed to stop testing long-range missiles that threaten the US mainland, but short-range missiles in theory threaten North Korea's neighbors and the US troops stationed there. After the test, Trump said he did not think North Korea was \"ready to negotiate.\"  Pyongyang has hinted it's looking for a more phased, step-by-step process in order to build confidence between the two sides. Washington worries this approach could be easily exploited by North Korea. The catch-22 is that North Korea will likely on get rid of its nuclear weapons program if it has a trusting and stable relationship with the United States. And the US will likely only develop a normal relationship with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program.  Trump may not have the time to develop that trust, and trashing the Iran nuclear deal -- despite the fact that Tehran has been found in compliance of the pact by the International Atomic Energy Agency -- put him in a tougher negotiating position.  Trump's supporters argued abandoning the Iran deal would send a clear signal to Kim Jong Un about the type of deal the Trump administration would be willing to negotiate.  But his critics say throwing it out proved to Pyongyang, Tehran or any other party willing to negotiate with the United States that any agreement might only last as long as the president who signed it. That's a big handicap for a president who touts the power of personal relationships in reaching agreements -- going as far as saying he \"fell in love\" with Kim.

{"id": 219, "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told Russian President Vladimir Putin that he believes the United States acted in \"bad faith\" at the Hanoi summit, North Korean state media reported.  The report in North Korea's state-run KCNA news was released on the final day of Kim's visit to the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok. Kim and Putin met there for the first time Thursday, spending about three and a half hours together. The North Korean leader left Vladivostok Friday afternoon aboard his armored government train.  KCNA reported that \"Kim Jong Un said that the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the region is now at a standstill, and has reached a critical point where it may return to its original state, as the US took a unilateral attitude in bad faith at the recent second DPRK-US summit talks,\" using the acronym for North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  KCNA also said Kim told his Russian hosts that \"peace and security on the Korean Peninsula will entirely depend on the US' future attitude, and the DPRK will guard itself for every possible situation.\" US President Donald Trump's second meeting with Kim in Hanoi in February ended earlier than expected and without a deal. Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two sides could not agree on the amount of sanctions relief to exchange for concrete steps by North Korea to eliminate its nuclear weapons program.  While Trump said both sides left things on good terms, North Korean officials have accused the US of sabotaging the talks.  Diplomats from Pyongyang have used similar language to Kim's in describing US demands at the Hanoi summit. North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters in March that the country has \"no intention to yield to the US demands (put forward at the Hanoi summit) in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind.\" Putin and Kim did not sign any documents or agreements after their meetings, though they weren't expected to. The summit was instead heavy on lavish symbolism and platitudinous remarks about mutual friendship. Kim called the relationship \"a precious treasure of our two nation's people that is an amalgamation of the mutual goal and interest based on historical tradition.\" Analysts say the meeting may have been attempt by the Russian leader to reinsert Moscow into one of the most important regional conflicts after months of sitting on the sidelines while China, South Korea and the US engaged in diplomatic talks with North Korea.  Others say Pyongyang may have been shopping for deals, seeking to lessen its economic reliance on Beijing and hedge against the possibility that talks with Washington fail.  \"The trip is more about stirring other interlocutors into renewed talks/concessions,\" said Robert Kelly, a professor of international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 12, "Organization"], [20, 31, "Person"], [37, 44, "Organization"], [55, 69, "Person"], [87, 104, "Organization"], [133, 138, "Location"], [147, 159, "Location"], [197, 208, "Location"], [221, 225, "Organization"], [264, 267, "Person"], [311, 322, "Location"], [324, 327, "Person"], [332, 337, "Person"], [367, 375, "Time"], [425, 441, "Organization"], [454, 465, "Location"], [466, 482, "Time"], [521, 525, "Organization"], [541, 552, "Person"], [580, 600, "Location"], [787, 791, "Organization"], [792, 794, "Organization"], [832, 843, "Organization"], [859, 900, "Organization"], [903, 907, "Organization"], [918, 921, "Person"], [931, 938, "Organization"], [973, 993, "Location"], [1018, 1024, "Organization"], [1047, 1055, "Organization"], [1105, 1107, "Organization"], [1118, 1130, "Person"], [1153, 1156, "Person"], [1160, 1166, "Location"], [1166, 1177, "Time"], [1226, 1231, "Person"], [1258, 1269, "Person"], [1373, 1384, "Organization"], [1434, 1439, "Person"], [1483, 1495, "Organization"], [1519, 1526, "Organization"], [1567, 1576, "Organization"], [1607, 1610, "Person"], [1627, 1629, "Person"], [1645, 1650, "Location"], [1659, 1671, "Organization"], [1700, 1712, "Person"], [1784, 1790, "Organization"], [1728, 1736, "Time"], [1819, 1825, "Location"], [1906, 1911, "Person"], [1916, 1919, "Person"], [2116, 2119, "Person"], [2330, 2341, "Organization"], [2361, 2367, "Organization"], [2465, 2470, "Organization"], [2472, 2483, "Organization"], [2488, 2494, "Organization"], [2528, 2539, "Organization"], [2553, 2562, "Organization"], [2640, 2647, "Location"], [2698, 2708, "Organization"], [2892, 2903, "Location"], [2863, 2888, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 220, "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin can be forgiven for appearing slightly weary at the banquet he hosted Thursday for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un: The venue in the far eastern city of Vladivostok is seven time zones ahead of Moscow. During a lavish state dinner that featured crab salad, borscht and a chocolate cheesecake festooned with North Korean and Russian flags, both Putin and Kim repeated nearly note-for-note many of the platitudinous remarks they made about mutual friendship at their summit appearances. Putin's toast, however, alluded to the subtext of the summit: The ongoing and unresolved crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. \"We welcome DPRK leadership's steps to establish a dialogue with the US and to normalize relations between South and North Koreas,\" he said. \"We're coming from a stand that there's no alternative to peaceful solution of nuclear and other problems of the region.\" That dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington, however, has faltered. Back in February, President Donald Trump walked away from a summit in Hanoi with Kim with no joint agreement after the North Korean leader insisted all US sanctions be lifted on his country. Thursday's Russia-North Korean summit also ended without a joint statement, a typical feature of such high-level meetings between heads of state. But visuals mattered in Vladivostok perhaps as much as words. Absent many details about the closed-door meetings, much of the coverage focused on the theatrics around the summit, including the seemingly \"Game of Thrones\"-themed gifts (the two leaders exchanged ornate swords) and the North Korean leader's somewhat sinister-looking choice of transport (Kim arrived from Pyongyang on an armored train). And the fact that the summit seemed to go as planned was, well, a victory for the Kremlin. Once again, it does appear that Putin has been able to position himself as an important diplomatic broker. In remarks to reporters following the summit, Putin said he would be relaying the results of his talks with Kim to other world leaders. Putin is taking part in a summit next in Beijing, where he said he would discuss the summit with his Chinese counterparts. \"Of course, I will speak tomorrow in Beijing with the leadership of the People's Republic of China, but we will also openly and frankly discuss today's meeting with the American leadership,\" he said. \"There are no secrets here, Russia's position is always open, there are no conspiracies.\" And the Kremlin leader said Kim himself asked the Russian leader to relay his position to the US side. \"Kim Jong Un himself asked us to inform the American side about his position, about the issues that arose for him in connection with the processes that are taking place on and around the Korean Peninsula,\" he said.

{"id": 223, "text": "China and Russia have sent home more than half of their North Korean workers, likely tens of thousands of people, according to reports submitted to the UN North Korean Security Council sanctions committee. Russia's report said that the number of North Korean workers with valid work permits decreased from 30,023 to 11,490 persons. In its report, China, the strongest ally of North Korea, said more of half of its income-earning North Korean nationals had been repatriated.  A UN diplomat confirmed to CNN that one-page reports from Beijing and Moscow were sent to the committee on sanctions, as required by a December 2017 Council resolution demanding repatriation of all North Korean workers by the end of this year.  Reuters first reported this story. CNN could not immediately confirm the figures given and China has previously been accused of trying to find ways around North Korea sanctions. China's report also noted that it does not wish for the submission to be made public. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was \"faithfully and strictly\" implementing UN sanctions against North Korea. The US has pushed in recent years for sanctions on North Korea to be strengthened.  On Thursday, the US sanctioned two Chinese shipping firms accused of helping North Korea evade restrictions, although a tweet by US President Donald Trump later cast confusion around the measures. \"Everyone should take notice and review their own activities to ensure they are not involved in North Korea's sanctions evasion,\" US national security adviser John Bolton said on his Twitter at the time. The United States believes that North Korea has some 100,000 workers abroad, with the majority in China and Russia. North Korean workers overseas are seen as a source of funding for the country's nuclear and missile program, so repatriating them cuts off a vital lifeline for the regime.  The US State Department previously described the North Korean workforce in Russia as \"slave-like\" labor. During a visit to St Petersburg in January 2018, CNN saw laborers living in shabby living quarters, building apartment blocks. North Korea has long sought the removal of UN sanctions which have put a stranglehold on their economy, portraying them as a violations of sovereignty. The Trump administration blamed a disagreement over sanctions for a breakdown of talks between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un at their Vietnam summit in March.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 5, "Organization"], [10, 16, "Organization"], [56, 68, "Location"], [152, 154, "Organization"], [155, 184, "Organization"], [206, 212, "Location"], [246, 258, "Location"], [347, 352, "Organization"], [376, 387, "Organization"], [429, 441, "Location"], [477, 479, "Organization"], [502, 505, "Organization"], [533, 540, "Location"], [545, 551, "Location"], [610, 623, "Time"], [673, 685, "Location"], [694, 717, "Time"], [720, 727, "Organization"], [755, 758, "Organization"], [811, 816, "Organization"], [875, 886, "Organization"], [898, 903, "Organization"], [1008, 1018, "Time"], [1020, 1044, "Organization"], [1055, 1066, "Person"], [1072, 1077, "Organization"], [1121, 1123, "Organization"], [1142, 1153, "Organization"], [1155, 1161, "Organization"], [1206, 1217, "Organization"], [1239, 1250, "Time"], [1252, 1258, "Organization"], [1316, 1327, "Organization"], [1368, 1370, "Organization"], [1381, 1393, "Person"], [1532, 1543, "Location"], [1566, 1568, "Organization"], [1595, 1606, "Person"], [1640, 1657, "Organization"], [1672, 1683, "Organization"], [1738, 1743, "Location"], [1748, 1754, "Location"], [1756, 1768, "Location"], [1929, 1952, "Organization"], [1978, 1990, "Location"], [2004, 2010, "Location"], [2052, 2065, "Location"], [2066, 2081, "Time"], [2083, 2086, "Organization"], [2161, 2172, "Organization"], [2204, 2206, "Organization"], [2317, 2322, "Person"], [2408, 2413, "Person"], [2418, 2429, "Organization"], [2432, 2443, "Person"], [2453, 2460, "Location"], [2468, 2476, "Time"]]}
{"id": 224, "text": "North Korea is withdrawing from a joint liaison office near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) with South Korea, a key symbol of the rapprochement and ongoing peace process between the two countries.  The move comes after the US slapped two Chinese firms with sanctions for doing business with Pyongyang, the first action taken by Washington against North Korea since the second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in Hanoi ended early with no agreement.  South Korea's Unification Ministry announced the move Friday, saying the decision had been taken by the North on \"instructions from the superior authority.\"  In its communication with the South, Pyongyang said it would not mind Seoul's representatives \"remaining in the office,\" which is based in Kaesong, a part of North Korea near the de facto border between the two countries.  The office was established after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met at the DMZ for an historic summit last year, which was followed by a meeting between Kim and US President Donald Trump in Singapore.  Pyongyang said it would notify Seoul regarding \"further practical matters in the future.\"  In the statement, the Unification Ministry said South Korea regrets the decision, and urged the North to return soon and continue the work being done at the liaison office towards a full peace settlement.  \"We regard such a withdrawal as very sad and unfortunate (and) we hope that the North will return shortly and hope that the liaison contact office will operate normally as soon as possible,\" Vice Minister of Unification Chun Hae-sung said at a press conference in Seoul Friday.  \"We believe that we should take some time to judge (the situation).\" North Korea has yet to issue any direct public statement on the decision to withdraw. Chad O'Carroll, an analyst and chief executive of the Korea Risk Group, said the move was to be expected following the failure of the Hanoi summit.  \"North Korea's pull-out Friday from the Kaesong Liason Office has been on cards since Hanoi, given recent no-shows there,\" he said on Twitter.  He added that the move was designed to send a message that from Pyongyang's perspective \"Seoul has insufficient influence\" over the US-North Korea relationship and that intra-Korean talks are increasingly pointless, \"when sanctions prevent practical cooperation.\" Following the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, the US and South Korea canceled major war games that have long been a source of tensions on the Korean Peninsula in order to \"support diplomatic efforts\" with Pyongyang. Speaking on Thursday, Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was \"absolutely confident\" that smaller exercises held in place of the traditional war games enabled the US and South Korean forces to \"maintain readiness.\"  Saying it was his job to be \"the glass half-empty guy when it comes to North Korean capabilities,\" Dunford said he still saw a potential but as yet undemonstrated capability \"to match a nuclear weapon with an intercontinental ballistic missile, and I think its incumbent on the United States military to be prepared to defend the homeland and our allies from that eventuality.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 11, "Organization"], [94, 105, "Organization"], [216, 222, "Organization"], [288, 297, "Organization"], [325, 335, "Organization"], [344, 355, "Organization"], [388, 400, "Organization"], [408, 419, "Person"], [424, 426, "Organization"], [437, 449, "Person"], [453, 458, "Location"], [491, 502, "Organization"], [505, 525, "Organization"], [545, 551, "Time"], [591, 600, "Organization"], [675, 684, "Organization"], [686, 695, "Organization"], [719, 724, "Organization"], [788, 795, "Location"], [807, 818, "Location"], [905, 908, "Person"], [936, 947, "Person"], [913, 925, "Organization"], [986, 995, "Time"], [1037, 1040, "Person"], [1045, 1047, "Organization"], [1058, 1070, "Person"], [1074, 1083, "Location"], [1086, 1095, "Organization"], [1117, 1122, "Organization"], [1195, 1219, "Organization"], [1225, 1236, "Organization"], [1269, 1278, "Organization"], [1459, 1468, "Organization"], [1603, 1616, "Person"], [1647, 1652, "Location"], [1653, 1659, "Time"], [1731, 1742, "Organization"], [1817, 1831, "Person"], [1867, 1887, "Organization"], [1951, 1956, "Location"], [1967, 1978, "Organization"], [1990, 1996, "Time"], [2002, 2027, "Location"], [2052, 2057, "Location"], [2174, 2183, "Organization"], [2199, 2204, "Organization"], [2242, 2244, "Organization"], [2245, 2256, "Organization"], [2285, 2291, "Organization"], [2388, 2393, "Person"], [2394, 2397, "Person"], [2408, 2413, "Location"], [2415, 2421, "Organization"], [2426, 2437, "Organization"], [2507, 2527, "Location"], [2574, 2583, "Organization"], [2594, 2605, "Time"], [2607, 2621, "Person"], [2635, 2663, "Organization"], [2774, 2780, "Organization"], [2785, 2797, "Organization"], [2902, 2914, "Organization"], [2930, 2937, "Person"], [3105, 3131, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 225, "text": "North Korea is considering suspension of denuclearization talks with the United States, Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters on Friday. \"We have no intention to yield to the US demands [put forward at the Hanoi summit] in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,\" said Choe, according to Russian state news agency TASS, which attended the press event in Pyongyang. Choe said the North was deeply disappointed by the failure of the two sides to reach any agreements at last month's summit between Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi. She blamed the breakdown of talks on the US side, saying the American delegation was being too demanding and inflexible: [The US] \"were too busy with pursuing their own political interests and had no sincere intention to achieve a result,\" Choe added, according to TASS. However, US National Security Advisor John Bolton disputed Choe's characterization of the breakdown of talks as \"inaccurate\" and said he had discussed the reports from North Korea with his South Korean counterparts. \"Just in the past hour, I spoke with my South Korean counterpart and we've discussed their reaction and our reaction, but I would like to speak further within US government before we respond,\" Bolton told reporters on the White House North Lawn Friday. \"Let me start by saying the obvious -- that diplomacy is still very much alive,\" Stephen Biegun said at the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference in Washington, DC on Monday. \"While we haven't made as much progress in the six months as I would've hoped coming in on the first day, we stay closely engaged with our counterparts in North Korea.\" He downplayed recent satellite images that analysts say show activity at North Korean missile sites and urged against making any \"snap judgment\" on the significance of the images that appear to show that North Korea has begun rebuilding a portion of the Sohae facility previously used to test long-range missile engines. \"We don't know\" what Kim will decide to do in the future and that any decision to resume such testing may \"very much be his decision, and his decision alone,\" Biegun said. He also noted that Trump has \"made clear\" how disappointed he would be if testing resumed. A senior US defense official told CNN Monday that the commercial satellite imagery doesn't show anything that raises imminent alarm for the US at this time. North Korea acknowledged for the first time last Friday that the Hanoi summit ended \"unexpectedly without an agreement.\" Despite previously painting the Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam in a positive light, state news agency KCNA said the meeting hadn't gone as well as expected. The US had hoped the summit would demonstrate the success of Trump's diplomatic gamble with North Korea, but instead the meeting ended with no joint agreement, after Kim demanded all US sanctions be lifted on his country. \"Sometimes you have to walk,\" Trump said during a news conference following the conclusion of the talks, which broke up earlier than planned. \"This was just one of those times.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 11, "Organization"], [69, 86, "Organization"], [112, 124, "Person"], [140, 149, "Time"], [185, 191, "Organization"], [220, 225, "Location"], [312, 316, "Person"], [357, 361, "Organization"], [331, 356, "Organization"], [397, 406, "Location"], [408, 412, "Person"], [418, 427, "Organization"], [539, 550, "Organization"], [568, 580, "Person"], [610, 615, "Location"], [588, 606, "Location"], [654, 665, "Organization"], [739, 745, "Organization"], [857, 861, "Location"], [882, 886, "Organization"], [926, 937, "Person"], [947, 951, "Person"], [1056, 1067, "Organization"], [1077, 1089, "Organization"], [1144, 1156, "Organization"], [1263, 1265, "Organization"], [1297, 1303, "Person"], [1322, 1348, "Location"], [1349, 1355, "Time"], [1438, 1452, "Person"], [1517, 1531, "Location"], [1532, 1541, "Time"], [1698, 1709, "Organization"], [1785, 1797, "Organization"], [1916, 1927, "Organization"], [1966, 1971, "Location"], [2054, 2057, "Person"], [2192, 2198, "Person"], [2224, 2229, "Person"], [2305, 2315, "Organization"], [2330, 2333, "Organization"], [2334, 2340, "Time"], [2432, 2438, "Organization"], [2453, 2464, "Organization"], [2497, 2508, "Time"], [2518, 2523, "Location"], [2606, 2611, "Person"], [2612, 2615, "Person"], [2626, 2633, "Location"], [2673, 2677, "Organization"], [2728, 2734, "Organization"], [2789, 2794, "Person"], [2820, 2831, "Organization"], [2894, 2897, "Person"], [2911, 2913, "Organization"], [2980, 2985, "Person"]]}
{"id": 226, "text": "Malaysian prosecutors rejected an appeal to drop a murder charge against one of the two women accused of using the deadly nerve agent VX to murder the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, just days after allowing her co-defendant to walk free. The decision means that Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam will remain as the only suspect in the case still behind bars.  Huong was one of two women charged with the February 2017 murder of Kim Jong Nam, an offense punishable by hanging. The other, Indonesian national Siti Aisyah, was freed Monday in a surprise ruling and returned to Indonesia hours later. Prosecutors did not reveal why they rejected Huong's appeal but let Aisyah go free. Huong's legal team had petitioned prosecutors to release her on the same grounds as Aisyah, arguing it would be unfair to free one of the co-defendants but not the other. However Huong told reporters through an interpreter that she wasn't bitter Aisyah was freed and she was not.  \"God knows me and Siti Aisyah didn't do anything,\" Huong said, according to her interpreter. After the ruling was announced, Huong wept and pressed Vietnamese ambassador to Malaysia Lê Quý Quỳnh's hands to her forehead. Quỳnh later told CNN that the Vietnamese justice minister had sent a letter to Malaysia's attorney general requesting Huong's release.  \"She's a little bit nervous and weak,\" Quỳnh said.  He said Hanoi would again request that Malaysian authorities treat Huong fairly and release her \"as soon as possible.\"  Huong's lawyer, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, called the decision not to drop the case \"disappointing\" in court Thursday.  \"The decision not to withdraw does not sit well with our criminal justice system. There is discrimination as the prosecution favors one party to the other,\" he said.  \"Both presented same defense before this court ... The public prosecutor has not acted fairly.\" Judge Azmi Ariffin adjourned court on \"humanitarian grounds,\" saying Huong appeared \"not well.\" He then ordered a doctor evaluate her.  Court will resume on April 1.  The other suspects Four North Koreans who fled Malaysia for an unknown destination shortly after the assassination were also charged in absentia with the murder. The international police organization Interpol has issued red notices asking governments around the world to send them back to face trial. Analysts said if North Korea was behind the killing, Kim Jong Un may have seen his older half-brother as a potential leadership threat -- even though their father, former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, had long discounted Kim Jong Nam as a possible successor.  Kim Jong Nam fell out of favor some two decades ago and lived in self-imposed exile in the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau. North Korea has consistently denied involvement in the killing, though US, South Korean and Malaysian authorities have said Pyongyang was responsible. Huong, Aisyah and the four North Koreans were accused of exposing Kim to the VX as he entered an airport in Kuala Lumpur on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital, killing him in minutes. Prosecutors alleged that Huong and Aisyah wiped Kim's face with the chemical before washing themselves. The North Koreans then promptly left the country.  Lawyers for the two women argued they were duped by the North Korean agents, who tricked them into thinking they were taking part in a reality TV show.  Malaysian authorities disagreed. During the police investigation and through most of the trial, police and prosecutors were adamant that both women knew what they were doing, which made Monday's developments all the more surprising. Indonesia lobbies for Aisyah Indonesian authorities said earlier this week that Malaysia had agreed to release their citizen due in part to intense lobbying by Jakarta. Indonesia's Law and Human Rights Ministry sent a formal letter to Malaysian Attorney General Tommy Thomas, to which he responded on Friday last week. Aisyah told CNN in an interview, Wednesday, that she agreed to take part in the reality TV show as side job to make some extra money. She said she was offered the job by a Malaysian man and ended up earning about $120, but declined to speak at length about the case.   \"My message to the other woman workers, please don't easily trust the others. If you want to do something, you have to understand what is that exactly,\" she said. After Aisyah's release on Monday, Vietnamese authorities appeared to step up their own efforts to free Huong.  Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh urged his Malaysian counterpart Tuesday to \"ensure fair judgement for Huong & to set her free,\" according to an image tweeted by his ministry. Vietnamese authorities had been tight-lipped about the case. They did not disclose whether Huong's detention was discussed during Kim Jong Un's visit last month to Hanoi, where he met US President Donald Trump and Vietnamese leaders.  Those meetings would have been unthinkable back in 2017, when Kim Jong Nam's assassination was widely seen as evidence of his half-brother's brutal but calculating leadership style. It was not until the following year that Kim Jong Un made a dramatic foray into diplomacy, holding his first historic summit with Trump in Singapore and also meeting the leaders of South Korea and China.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 9, "Location"], [167, 179, "Organization"], [187, 198, "Person"], [280, 294, "Person"], [298, 305, "Location"], [370, 375, "Person"], [410, 427, "Time"], [438, 450, "Person"], [517, 528, "Person"], [497, 507, "Location"], [540, 546, "Time"], [584, 593, "Location"], [652, 657, "Person"], [675, 681, "Person"], [691, 696, "Person"], [870, 875, "Person"], [1023, 1028, "Person"], [1097, 1102, "Person"], [1447, 1452, "Person"], [1946, 1951, "Person"], [1310, 1315, "Person"], [2896, 2902, "Person"], [3112, 3118, "Person"], [3640, 3646, "Person"], [3937, 3943, "Person"], [4375, 4381, "Person"], [990, 1001, "Person"], [775, 781, "Person"], [937, 943, "Person"], [1500, 1505, "Person"], [4746, 4751, "Person"], [4582, 4587, "Person"], [4472, 4477, "Person"], [3102, 3107, "Person"], [2889, 2894, "Person"], [2398, 2409, "Person"], [2536, 2547, "Person"], [2569, 2581, "Person"], [2608, 2620, "Person"], [2955, 2958, "Person"], [3125, 3128, "Person"], [4785, 4796, "Person"], [4952, 4964, "Person"], [5113, 5124, "Person"], [1120, 1130, "Location"], [1145, 1153, "Location"], [1154, 1166, "Person"], [1192, 1197, "Person"], [1209, 1212, "Person"], [1222, 1232, "Organization"], [1271, 1279, "Location"], [1367, 1372, "Person"], [1388, 1393, "Organization"], [1419, 1440, "Organization"], [1516, 1535, "Person"], [1603, 1611, "Time"], [1883, 1895, "Person"], [2031, 2041, "Time"], [2091, 2099, "Location"], [2244, 2252, "Organization"], [2362, 2373, "Organization"], [2516, 2528, "Organization"], [2731, 2736, "Location"], [2738, 2749, "Organization"], [2809, 2811, "Organization"], [2813, 2825, "Organization"], [2830, 2839, "Organization"], [2862, 2871, "Organization"], [2916, 2929, "Organization"], [2997, 3009, "Location"], [3034, 3043, "Location"], [3181, 3198, "Organization"], [3284, 3300, "Organization"], [3385, 3394, "Organization"], [3571, 3577, "Time"], [3618, 3627, "Location"], [3675, 3692, "Time"], [3698, 3706, "Organization"], [3778, 3785, "Location"], [3787, 3828, "Organization"], [3880, 3892, "Person"], [3916, 3925, "Time"], [3949, 3952, "Time"], [3970, 3979, "Time"], [4109, 4118, "Location"], [4392, 4401, "Time"], [4403, 4413, "Organization"], [4497, 4511, "Person"], [4544, 4551, "Time"], [4655, 4665, "Organization"], [4839, 4842, "Organization"], [4852, 4864, "Person"], [4869, 4879, "Organization"], [4938, 4945, "Time"], [5202, 5207, "Person"], [5211, 5220, "Location"], [5253, 5264, "Organization"], [5269, 5274, "Organization"]]}
{"id": 227, "text": "The Indonesian woman accused of using a deadly nerve agent to kill Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, returned home Monday after Malaysian prosecutors withdrew the charge against her. An emotional Siti Aisyah, surrounded by government officials and reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jakarta, thanked her parents, President Joko Widodo and the Indonesian people for their prayers.  The decision came as a surprise to many, including Aisyah herself, and kicked off a dramatic day at the Shah Alam High Court.  Aisyah hugged her co-defendant, Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam, before leaving the courtroom. She later tearfully told reporters that she was \"shocked\" to have been freed after more than two years behind bars. The prosecutors gave no reason for their decision, her lawyer Gooi Soon Seng said. The prosecutors did not ask the judge to drop charges against Huong, a decision her lawyer criticized as \"unfair.\"  The trial is due to resume Thursday, when prosecutors are expected to announce whether they will continue with the case against Huong. Aisyah and Huong were charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam shortly after his death in February 2017, and faced the death penalty if convicted. Authorities say they exposed Kim to the nerve agent VX as he entered Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2, killing him in minutes. Security footage shows a woman approaching him from behind, rubbing something on his face and then running away. Lawyers for the two women have said they were duped by a team of North Korean agents, who tricked them into thinking they were taking part in a reality TV show.  Rusdi Kirana, Indonesia's ambassador to Malaysia, said the decision to drop the case against Aisyah followed months of lobbying by Jakarta. The Indonesian Law and Human Rights Ministry released an image of an undated letter in which it requested that Aisyah be freed.  The letter repeated many of the arguments made by her defense attorneys. It also asked that Malaysian authorities take into account the two countries' \"good relations\" when considering the request. Malaysian Attorney General Tommy Thomas responded with his own letter Friday, announcing that the prosecution would effectively drop the case. Copies of both letters were released by Indonesian authorities and a spokesman for Thomas confirmed their validity. Four North Koreans have also been charged with Kim's killing. Their whereabouts are unknown, and Interpol has put out red notices for each of them, asking governments around the world to send them to Malaysia to face trial. It's unclear why Kim Jong Nam was killed, but analysts said Kim Jong Un may have seen him as a potential threat. Kim Jong Nam fell out of favor with their father, former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, nearly two decades ago and lived in self-imposed exile in the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau. North Korea has consistently denied involvement in the killing, though United States, South Korean and Malaysian authorities have said it was in fact responsible for Kim's death.  Monday was the first time Huong and Aisyah had spoken publicly in the more than two years they spent behind bars. But Huong ended up only reading the first three lines of her prepared testimony in a tearful and stuttering tone.  Defense lawyer Hisyam Teh Poh Teik said she \"was traumatized by the unfair decision\" not to drop charges in her case, and her legal team had made a decision to stop the testimony.  \"Doan (Thi Huong) was obviously disappointed,\" Teh told reporters. \"She was in no position to testify.\" He said his team would request the withdrawal of the charge against her. 'Happy and so relieved' Aisyah had a tearful reunion with her parents Monday.  Asriya, Aisyah's father, said he was \"touched and happy\" about his daughter's release. \"A thousands of thousands thank you to all help we received. Thank you to Indonesia government that can release my daughter. Thank you President Jokowi.  I pray for you, may God protect you, \" Asriya said, overcome with emotion.  Indonesia's Foreign Ministry brought Aisyah's parents to the capital ahead of her return. Benah, Aisyah's mother, said she was \"happy and so relieved\" that her daughter had been freed. \"Since the very beginning we believe that she is not guilty. Siti is innocent. That's why we keep praying for her,\" she said.   Benah said she didn't know what would happen next, but she planned to \"make sure that Siti will only work at home.\" Speaking earlier at the Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Aisyah thanked her lawyers, Indonesian authorities and the Malaysian government for securing her release. \"I did not expect that today will be the day of my freedom,\" she said.  Diplomatic tensions Kim Jong Nam's murder triggered a heated three-week diplomatic row between Malaysia and North Korea, further isolating Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un was viewed by many at the time as a calculating and ruthless leader shrouded in mystery. It would be more than a year before his much publicized meetings with the leaders of South Korea, China and the US. The diplomatic dispute ended after nine Malaysians effectively barred from leaving Pyongyang were allowed to return home and three North Koreans were permitted to leave Malaysia.  It's unclear if Huong's detention has caused any friction between North Korea and Vietnam, one of the relatively few countries to maintain diplomatic relations with Pyongyang.  Huong's case did not appear to be publicly discussed during Kim Jong Un's recent visit to Hanoi, when he met US President Donald Trump and Vietnam's leaders. In an interview last month, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc appeared to play down tensions between his country and Pyongyang over the incident.  \"This is an issue of the law.

{"id": 228, "text": "North Korea has broken UN sanctions with a \"massive\" increase of oil imports and coal exports, a UN report has found. The 400-page document released Monday by the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea said that Pyongyang had also tried to sell weapons in the Middle East and hacked banks across the world. The report comes after the collapse of last month's talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam, in part due to disagreement over when to remove sanctions in exchange for steps toward Pyongyang's denuclearization.  The report said that Pyongyang rendered sanctions ineffective by increasing the number of ship-to-ship transfers it conducts at sea. Japanese officials have observed North Korean ships engaging in purported ship-to-ship transfers. \"The country continues to defy Security Council resolutions through a massive increase in illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products and coal,\" the UN report said.  North Korea's coal sales have historically been some of the country's most valuable exports. UN sanctions meant to punish Pyongyang for its 2017 missile and nuclear tests put a cap on the amount of coal the country was allowed to sell internationally. The measures also capped the amount of oil and energy products the country was allowed to import.  The report accused banks and insurance companies across the world of \"unwittingly\" facilitating and providing \"coverage for vessels involved in ever-larger... illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, and an increasing number of ship-to-ship coal transfers.\"  It added that North Korea \"has attempted to supply small arms and light weapons and other military equipment to Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as to Libya and the Sudan, via foreign intermediaries.\"  North Korea has long sought the removal of UN sanctions and portrayed the measures as violations of its sovereignty.  Kim Song, North Korea's envoy to the United Nations, sent a letter Monday to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calling for the UN Security Council to drop the sanctions, North Korean state media reported. \"The 'sanctions resolutions' of the Security Council against the DPRK (North Korea's official name), that prohibit even the shipment of computers and other electronic devices widely used at societies and homes of today, are indeed the action against humanity to destroy modern civilization and turn the society back in a (medieval) dark age,\" the letter read.  The issue of sanctions has been a key sticking point in talks between Washington and Pyongyang. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said North Korea asked for removal of five of the 11 sets of sanctions levied by the United Nations -- those that \"hamper the economy and the livelihood of our people.\"  But the Trump administration has said that price was too steep for what North Korea was offering.  \"We're just not there on denuclearization, and that was the issue at the summit that really challenged us to move forward with a more complete agreement,\"  Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for North Korea, said Monday.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[23, 25, "Organization"], [0, 11, "Organization"], [97, 99, "Organization"], [149, 155, "Time"], [159, 165, "Organization"], [186, 197, "Organization"], [208, 217, "Organization"], [252, 267, "Location"], [379, 391, "Location"], [396, 408, "Organization"], [416, 427, "Person"], [431, 436, "Location"], [438, 445, "Location"], [534, 543, "Organization"], [586, 595, "Organization"], [698, 706, "Organization"], [731, 743, "Organization"], [827, 843, "Organization"], [950, 956, "Organization"], [971, 982, "Organization"], [1064, 1066, "Organization"], [1093, 1102, "Organization"], [1111, 1115, "Time"], [1608, 1619, "Organization"], [1706, 1712, "Organization"], [1723, 1728, "Location"], [1744, 1749, "Location"], [1754, 1763, "Location"], [1795, 1806, "Organization"], [1838, 1840, "Organization"], [1913, 1921, "Location"], [1923, 1934, "Organization"], [1946, 1964, "Organization"], [1980, 1986, "Time"], [2011, 2027, "Person"], [2040, 2063, "Organization"], [2087, 2099, "Location"], [2154, 2174, "Organization"], [2183, 2191, "Organization"], [2553, 2563, "Organization"], [2568, 2577, "Organization"], [2579, 2591, "Organization"], [2609, 2619, "Person"], [2625, 2636, "Organization"], [2701, 2719, "Organization"], [2798, 2803, "Person"], [2862, 2873, "Person"], [3045, 3059, "Person"], [3095, 3106, "Person"], [3113, 3119, "Time"]]}
{"id": 229, "text": "Satellite images suggest that North Korea could be preparing to launch a missile or space rocket in the near future, analysts said Friday, signaling a potential blow to US-North Korea relations. The commercial images, taken on February 22 by imaging company DigitalGlobe, reveal an uptick in activity at a facility in Sanumdong, a suburb of the capital Pyongyang. North Korea has previously assembled some of its intercontinental ballistic missiles and satellite-launching rockets at Sanumdong. The release of the images follows an assessment by respected North Korea monitoring website 38 North that the Sohae satellite launch facility, which had been partially disassembled as part of disarmament steps, is now back to normal operational status after a flurry of restoration work in recent weeks -- work that appears to have picked up after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump's failed summit in Hanoi on February 28. \"We're seeing a lot of vehicle activity at the Sanumdong facility and also at the rail transfer point where it would be loaded and taken to Sohae,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who has studied the new images.  \"I think the evidence points to a satellite launch, and not just the evidence at Sanumdong, but also the evidence from Sohae.\" Satellite launches use similar technology as ballistic missiles, and experts have long maintained that North Korea's attempts to shoot satellites into space could help them develop viable long-range ballistic missiles. Lewis cautioned that it is impossible to know whether the North Koreans are preparing a military missile or a space rocket. It is also possible that the activity was a deliberate attempt to draw the attention of US spy satellites. The US State Department has declined to comment. \"Because that (Sanumdong) facility produces both ICBMs and space rockets, we don't know what's on the train,\" said Melissa Hanham, a North Korea expert with the One Earth Future Foundation. \"We also don't know how far the train has gotten.\" Hanham believes a satellite launch is the more likely scenario because there has never been an ICBM launch from Sohae. She also says activity at the launch site should indicate about a week in advance whether a launch is imminent. \"There's never been a surprise launch from Sohae,\" Hanham said. It's unclear if the recent developments will affect how the White House moves forward with North Korea. North Korea's missile program made strides in 2017, with Pyongyang saying it successfully test-fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say the Hwasong-15, which was launched in late November, can likely hit much of the United States. Trump has touted as progress the fact that North Korea has not conducted any missile or nuclear tests in more than a year. Speaking Wednesday before the release of the latest images, Trump said it was \"too early to see\" whether Kim had restarted the country's missile testing program but added that he would be \"very disappointed\" if that turned out to be the case. Asked whether Kim broke his promise, Trump told reporters: \"We're gonna see. It's too early to see. But we have to solve a problem. We have a really nasty problem. We have to solve a problem.\" Trump had previously said the two sides departed amicably from the summit and left the door open for future negotiations.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[30, 41, "Organization"], [131, 137, "Time"], [169, 171, "Organization"], [172, 183, "Organization"], [224, 238, "Time"], [258, 270, "Organization"], [318, 327, "Location"], [353, 362, "Location"], [364, 375, "Organization"], [484, 493, "Location"], [556, 567, "Location"], [587, 595, "Organization"], [843, 855, "Organization"], [863, 874, "Person"], [879, 881, "Organization"], [892, 904, "Person"], [924, 929, "Location"], [930, 944, "Time"], [993, 1002, "Location"], [605, 610, "Location"], [1086, 1091, "Location"], [1099, 1112, "Person"], [1126, 1164, "Organization"], [1168, 1229, "Organization"], [1345, 1354, "Location"], [1383, 1388, "Location"], [1494, 1505, "Organization"], [1610, 1615, "Person"], [1668, 1681, "Organization"], [1822, 1824, "Organization"], [1841, 1864, "Organization"], [1905, 1914, "Location"], [2005, 2019, "Person"], [2047, 2078, "Organization"], [2131, 2137, "Person"], [2243, 2248, "Location"], [2405, 2410, "Location"], [2413, 2419, "Person"], [2482, 2497, "Organization"], [2517, 2528, "Organization"], [2530, 2541, "Organization"], [2573, 2580, "Time"], [2587, 2596, "Location"], [2721, 2737, "Time"], [2762, 2779, "Organization"], [2781, 2786, "Person"], [2824, 2835, "Organization"], [2913, 2922, "Time"], [3161, 3164, "Person"], [3184, 3189, "Person"], [3340, 3345, "Person"]]}

The US hoped the summit would demonstrate the success of Trump's diplomatic gamble with North Korea, but instead the meeting ended with no joint agreement, after Kim demanded all US sanctions be lifted on his country. \"Sometimes you have to walk,\" Trump said during a news conference following the conclusion of the talks, which broke up earlier than planned. \"This was just one of those times.\" Friday's acknowledgment from North Korea comes after satellite images appeared to show that the country had begun rebuilding a portion of a facility previously used to test long-range missile engines, raising questions about the future of US-North Korea negotiations.

An estimated 11 million people inside the country -- nearly 44% -- are undernourished, the UN's 2019 North Korea Needs and Priorities report found. Food production fell by more than 9% from 5.45 million metric tons in 2017 to 4.95 million metric tons last year, in part due to \"shortages of arable land, lack of access to modern agricultural equipment and fertilizers and recurrent natural disasters,\" it said. Outlining the \"grim\" situation for millions of North Koreans, the UN called for $120 million worth of aid to be sent to the country.  \"Widespread under-nutrition threatens an entire generation of children,\" Tapan Mishra, the UN resident coordinator in North Korea, said in a statement, adding that the UN had been unable last year to reach hundreds of thousands of people it planned to help.   \"An estimated 1.4 million people didn't get food assistance. Just under 800,000 people were not able to access essential health services. An estimated 190,000 kindergarten children and 85,000 acutely malnourished children did not get the nutrition support they needed,\" said Mishra. \"Beyond the numbers, the human cost of our inability to respond is unmeasurable.\" North Korea has suffered several famines in recent years.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his predecessors have faced harsh international criticism for ignoring the needs of their people at the expense of other priorities, notably the nuclear weapons program.  North Korean negotiators, however, have said the country has chosen to engage US President Donald Trump in denuclearization talks in an effort to boost the economy and improve the people's livelihood.  But talks ended abruptly at last week's summit in Hanoi, after Trump said he walked away from the table when North Korea demanded the removal of all sanctions levied against it.  North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country asked the Trump administration to remove the \"sanctions that hamper the economy and the livelihood of our people.\" The measures have left Pyongyang isolated and without trading partners apart from China, which accounts for a large share of its international trade.

{"id": 236, "text": "The US and South Korea have canceled major war games that have long been a source of tensions on the Korean Peninsula in order to \"support diplomatic efforts\" with North Korea.  News of the cancellation comes after the second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended without an agreement, though the two sides did pledge to continue to work towards denuclearization and a peace settlement.  In a statement, South Korea said Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and acting US Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan had discussed the summit and expected more \"active dialogue between the US and North Korea based on the outcome of the talks.\" \"Through close consultation between the authorities of South Korea and US Defense, the two concluded to end Key Resolve and Foal Eagle,\" the statement said, referring to the two major annual drills that typically involve tens of thousands of US and South Korean troops and mock events including rehearsals for invading North Korea.  The drills are regularly denounced by Pyongyang where they are regarded as preparations for a potential invasion. The drills have previously been used by North Korea to justify the country's advanced weapons programs.  China too has called on the US to cancel the exercises in return for North Korea pursuing denuclearization.  The drills were put on hold last year ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics, as the two Koreas began talks which eventually resulted in a summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and later Kim and Trump.  Trump himself has been a critic of the drills in the past. On Sunday, he tweeted that their cancellation would \"save hundreds of millions of dollars for the US.\"  \"That was my position long before I became President,\" he added. \"Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!\" Downsizing US officials said smaller joint exercises -- called \"Dongmaeng\" -- would be carried out later this month, from March 4 through March 12, in place of Key Resolve. Much smaller, battalion-sized exercises will take place later this year to replace Foal Eagle.  The willingness of US and South Korean officials to cancel the long-running drills is a sign both of a continued push on both sides towards a diplomatic outcome, and the radically reduced tensions on the Peninsula since talks began.  North Korea has not conducted any missile or nuclear tests since late 2017, and following the talks in Vietnam with Trump, Kim pledged to continue this pause.  South Korea's statement said the decision \"is a reflection of both countries' expectations in support of diplomatic efforts to mitigate tensions and achieve a complete denuclearization in a final and fully verifiable way.\"  Both Koreas have agreed to work towards a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War, which ended in armistice in 1953, and scaled back the militarization of the de facto border between the two countries.  Critics of the drills have long complained that they are a needless source of tensions, equivalent to North Korea's missile launches, and not necessary from a US military perspective.  China in particular has frequently called on the US to cancel the drills as a first step towards denuclearization.  Long history Joint US-South Korean war games have been held since fighting ended on the Peninsula in 1953. The drills themselves often mimic real-life combat situations -- amphibious landings, intense live-fire exercises, counter-terrorism drills and simulated or tabletop battle plans. Speaking after the Key Resolve drills in March 2017, US Forces Korea deputy commander US Lt. Gen. Thomas Bergeson said the alliance's mission \"is first and foremost to deter any aggression from North Korea.\" \"If that deterrence fails then we are in a position to defend the Republic of Korea. And if we defend, we are going to defeat the enemy and win,\" he said in a statement. Daniel Pinkston, a professor of International Relations at Troy University in Seoul, previously told CNN the exercises are vital practice for forces based in South Korea, especially those US troops who rotate into the region on year-long deployments. \"There are a lot of scenarios of tasks you might have to do during a very wide range of scenarios,\" he said. \"Very complex things that have to be coordinated and executed.\" Not holding the exercises, Pinkston added, risks weakening \"the capacity of the South Korean military and the USFK to respond to a variety of military contingencies\" and could invite aggression. In the statement this week, South Korean and US officials said that \"communication between the US and South Korea is ongoing more smoothly than ever in the changing security environment on the Korean Peninsula.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 6, "Organization"], [11, 22, "Organization"], [97, 117, "Location"], [164, 175, "Organization"], [241, 243, "Organization"], [254, 266, "Person"], [271, 283, "Organization"], [291, 302, "Person"], [449, 460, "Organization"], [483, 499, "Person"], [535, 551, "Person"], [620, 626, "Organization"], [631, 642, "Organization"], [734, 745, "Organization"], [750, 760, "Organization"], [921, 923, "Organization"], [928, 947, "Organization"], [998, 1009, "Organization"], [1050, 1059, "Organization"], [1166, 1177, "Organization"], [1231, 1236, "Organization"], [1255, 1261, "Organization"], [1300, 1311, "Organization"], [1391, 1395, "Time"], [1424, 1430, "Organization"], [1489, 1492, "Person"], [1497, 1509, "Organization"], [1520, 1531, "Person"], [1543, 1546, "Person"], [1551, 1556, "Person"], [1559, 1564, "Person"], [1618, 1627, "Time"], [1712, 1718, "Organization"], [1817, 1828, "Organization"], [1871, 1873, "Organization"], [1959, 1975, "Time"], [1977, 2006, "Time"], [2148, 2150, "Organization"], [2155, 2167, "Organization"], [2363, 2374, "Organization"], [2422, 2437, "Time"], [2466, 2473, "Location"], [2479, 2484, "Person"], [2486, 2489, "Person"], [2523, 2534, "Organization"], [2747, 2758, "Organization"], [2858, 2865, "Time"], [3055, 3066, "Organization"], [3112, 3123, "Organization"], [3138, 3143, "Organization"], [3183, 3189, "Organization"], [3352, 3359, "Time"], [3579, 3592, "Time"], [3594, 3603, "Organization"], [3639, 3654, "Person"], [3811, 3832, "Organization"], [3735, 3746, "Organization"], [3919, 3934, "Person"], [3978, 3993, "Time"], [3997, 4002, "Location"], [4020, 4023, "Organization"], [4077, 4088, "Location"], [4107, 4116, "Organization"], [4370, 4378, "Location"], [4419, 4444, "Organization"], [4449, 4457, "Organization"], [4566, 4578, "Organization"], [4583, 4585, "Organization"], [4629, 4635, "Organization"], [4640, 4651, "Organization"], [4727, 4747, "Location"]]}
{"id": 237, "text": "North Korea asked for only a partial lifting of sanctions during a meeting this week with US President Donald Trump, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said during a rare news conference early Friday morning.  Pyongyang would be willing to allow US experts to witness North Korea permanently dismantle uranium and plutonium production facilities at its Yongbyon nuclear site if the US removed partial sanctions, Ri said. \"If the US removes partial sanctions, the articles of sanctions that hamper the economy and the livelihood of our people, we will permanently and completely dismantle all the material in the nuclear material production facilities in the Yongbyon area including plutonium and uranium,\" he said. Ri made the comments just hours after Trump walked away from negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. The US President said he did so because North Korea demanded the removal of all sanctions levied against Pyongyang. \"Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn't do that,\" Trump said at a news conference following the summit.  Ri appeared to suggest Trump's claims were incorrect, saying North Korea only asked for the removal of five of the 11 sets of sanctions levied by the United Nations Security Council to punish Pyongyang for its repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests.  Those sanctions have stood in the way of Kim's efforts to improve the North Korean economy and raise the livelihood of his people, one of the young North Korean leader's stated goals for his country. Speaking Friday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his country would push forward in promoting peace on the Peninsula.  \"The second North Korea-United States summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, made meaningful progress, given the fact that the two leaders had conversations at length, enhanced mutual understanding and built more trust,\" he said.  \"The spring of peace that arrived on the Korean Peninsula was not ushered in by someone else. It is an outcome accomplished by ourselves -- by the power of the people.\" Moon, who has been the primary driver of the peace process, said that progress between the two Koreas \"will lead to the normalization of North Korea's relations with the United States and Japan, later expanding into a new order of peace and security in Northeast Asia.\" \"Unification need not be far away,\" he added. \"Achieving a unity of mind while acknowledging differences and establishing mutually beneficial relations -- this is exactly what unification is all about.\" Denuclearization dispute Kim said early last year that his country had completed its quest to obtain viable nuclear weapons and would solely focus on economic development.  However, analysts say Pyongyang still considers nuclear weapons key to its survival. Ri called the North Korean proposal \"the biggest denuclearization measure we can take at the present stage in relation to the current level of confidence\" between the two countries, according to his translator.  Ri also said North Korea would commit to permanently halt testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.  But the United States also demanded \"one more thing on top of (dismantling) Yongbyon,\" the country's only publicly known facility that produces fissile material for nuclear weapons, he said. Once that happened, Ri said, \"It became crystal clear that the US was not ready to accept our proposal.\" Trump characterized the lack of deal as only a short-term disappointment, even though he'd hoped coming into the talks to be able to point to a new, concrete pathway toward denuclearization. A major agreement struck in Hanoi might also have pushed aside embarrassing headlines about Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen testifying that the President is a racist con man. The personal chemistry that Trump has cultivated -- and loudly trumpeted -- with the young despotic leader remains intact, the President insisted. And the summit ended amicably, without either man storming away. Still, US and North Korean officials remain at odds about the precise definition of denuclearization, which is the stated goal of their efforts. \"He has a certain vision and it's not exactly our vision, but it's a lot closer than it was a year ago and I think eventually we'll get there,\" Trump said in his news conference after the summit. Trump also described Kim as singularly focused on ending the sanctions that have crippled his economy and helped bring him to the negotiating table in the first place.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 11, "Organization"], [90, 93, "Organization"], [103, 115, "Person"], [134, 144, "Person"], [180, 200, "Time"], [203, 212, "Organization"], [239, 241, "Organization"], [261, 272, "Organization"], [342, 367, "Location"], [371, 377, "Organization"], [405, 407, "Person"], [418, 424, "Organization"], [647, 664, "Location"], [708, 710, "Person"], [746, 751, "Person"], [787, 799, "Organization"], [807, 818, "Person"], [822, 829, "Location"], [831, 837, "Organization"], [871, 882, "Organization"], [936, 945, "Organization"], [1036, 1041, "Person"], [1091, 1093, "Person"], [1114, 1119, "Person"], [1152, 1163, "Organization"], [1237, 1272, "Organization"], [1283, 1292, "Organization"], [1389, 1392, "Person"], [1414, 1430, "Organization"], [1496, 1508, "Organization"], [1557, 1563, "Time"], [1565, 1577, "Organization"], [1588, 1599, "Person"], [1686, 1697, "Organization"], [1698, 1711, "Organization"], [1722, 1727, "Location"], [1729, 1736, "Location"], [1929, 1949, "Location"], [2061, 2065, "Person"], [2148, 2162, "Organization"], [2198, 2209, "Organization"], [2227, 2244, "Organization"], [2249, 2254, "Organization"], [2314, 2328, "Location"], [2559, 2562, "Person"], [2729, 2738, "Organization"], [2792, 2794, "Person"], [3004, 3006, "Person"], [3119, 3136, "Organization"], [3191, 3199, "Location"], [3326, 3328, "Person"], [3365, 3371, "Organization"], [3411, 3416, "Person"], [3630, 3635, "Location"], [3694, 3699, "Person"], [3716, 3729, "Person"], [3809, 3814, "Person"], [4000, 4002, "Organization"], [4007, 4019, "Organization"], [4282, 4287, "Person"], [4334, 4339, "Person"], [4355, 4358, "Person"]]}
{"id": 238, "text": "A container filled with 90,000 bottles of vodka believed to be for sanctions-hit North Korea has been seized by Dutch customs agents, officials said Tuesday. Three-thousand cases of the spirit were found by officers at the port of Rotterdam aboard a ship owned by China's Cosco Shipping, said Roul Velleman, a spokesman for the Dutch customs agency. Velleman said officers decided to check the container based on a \"risk profile\" provided by the Foreign Ministry. \"We follow a risk profile and we had information that this container could be carrying something,\" Velleman said. \"And it was right. It was vodka -- destination China, probably to go to North Korea.\" North Korea has been slapped with a number of international sanctions, which include a ban on the import of certain luxury goods, for its continued ballistic missile testing and violations of UN resolutions.  Those sanctions were the reason behind this particular seizure -- which was ordered by the Dutch minister for trade, Sigrid Kaag -- her spokesman said. \"The Security Council of the United Nations has imposed clear sanctions on North Korea, so it is important to enforce those sanctions,\" Kaag said, according to her spokesman, Jeroen van Dommelen. \"The sanctions also govern the import of luxury goods and so customs was completely justified in unloading that container.\" China, which is often highlighted as North Korea's largest trading partner and historically its closest ally, has previously said it has been enforcing the sanctions, despite skepticism from some analysts. Velleman declined to confirm whether the vodka was meant for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \"All we can say is it was for North Korea,\" he said. \"We're 90% sure (that was) its final destination.\" The seizure comes as Kim and US President Donald Trump are meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, for a two-day summit that is expected to build upon their agreement to \"work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[81, 92, "Organization"], [112, 117, "Location"], [149, 156, "Time"], [231, 240, "Location"], [264, 269, "Location"], [272, 286, "Organization"], [293, 306, "Person"], [324, 348, "Organization"], [350, 358, "Person"], [442, 462, "Organization"], [563, 571, "Person"], [664, 675, "Organization"], [625, 630, "Location"], [650, 661, "Location"], [856, 858, "Organization"], [964, 969, "Organization"], [990, 1001, "Person"], [1026, 1068, "Organization"], [1100, 1111, "Organization"], [1161, 1165, "Person"], [1200, 1219, "Person"], [1345, 1350, "Organization"], [1382, 1393, "Organization"], [1551, 1559, "Person"], [1612, 1624, "Organization"], [1632, 1643, "Person"], [1675, 1686, "Organization"], [1770, 1773, "Person"], [1778, 1780, "Organization"], [1791, 1803, "Person"], [1819, 1824, "Location"], [1826, 1833, "Location"], [1948, 1968, "Location"]]}
{"id": 239, "text": "Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said his country will \"spare no effort\" to host a successful summit between North Korea and the United States because in the end, it would be less costly than a war.  \"For the peace of the world, for a connected and developed world, let's shake hands. We shall develop together and contribute to global stability,\" Nguyen told CNN. In an international exclusive interview with CNN, Nguyen -- the second in line of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party -- said that the country hopes to play more than just host to US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but rather prove itself as an example of the benefits of peace, reconciliation and market liberalization. Kim arrived in Vietnam Tuesday after a two-and-a-half day train trip to the country. He was welcomed by Vietnamese officials and a guard of honor in the border city of Dong Dang. Kim then got into his Mercedes and headed to Hanoi, where he will meet Trump Wednesday and Thursday. Trump arrived in the city Tuesday night. The country is expected to reap some economic and public relations benefits by hosting the diplomatic event, and it is openly embracing its role as host. North Korean, US and Vietnamese flag displays can be seen throughout the city, and its vendors are selling shirts emblazoned with Kim and Trump's faces in addition to their usual fare.  Nguyen said Vietnam's war-torn history is an important motivator in hosting the event: \"Vietnam is doing her best to successfully organize the second US-DPRK summit in Hanoi. It's a historic moment in the path toward reconciliation and peace-making on the Korean peninsula. That is a very important commitment and responsibility for us.\" The prime minister added: \"We deeply appreciate the meaning of peace and reconciliation. Contributing towards peace is a responsibility of each nation in this day and age.\"  Vietnam is believed to have been chosen as the host of the summit for both practical and symbolic reasons. The country is accessible by train from North Korea and maintains diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. Kim visited his country's embassy in Hanoi shortly after arriving in the Vietnamese capital.  But Vietnam also is a powerful symbol for those trying to sell North Korea on giving up its nuclear weapons in exchange for US help to develop its economy. Hanoi has undergone a \"remarkable\" transformation, as the World Bank puts it, since embracing market liberalization in the 1980s without ceding political authority.  The Trump administration is expected to try to convince Kim to embrace an economic model similar to Vietnam's, but it's unclear how receptive Kim will be.  Vietnam's changed relationship with the United States is another point of pride that Nguyen said he hoped North Korea could find inspiration in.  The prime minister had close family fight and die in the war against the United States. When asked about his personal experience, Nguyen demurred. He said it was important not to dwell on the past. \"We don't forget our past, our history, but we need (closure) in order to look to the future. We need such mutual understanding to build our nations in peace, to better solve the problems in the lives of our citizens,\" he said. \"Millions of Vietnamese died throughout years of resistance wars to protect the country, our independence and freedom. More than ever, we value peace, based on mutual respect for each others' independence and sovereignty.\" Nguyen did not spend much time discussing the points of contention between Vietnam and North Korea, and appeared to play down tensions with Pyongyang over a Vietnamese citizen's alleged involvement in the killing of Kim's half-brother, Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia in February 2017. South Korea and Malaysia blamed North Korea for the killing, which Pyongyang vehemently denies. Two women, one Vietnamese and one Indonesian, are on trial for the crime.  When asked about reports that North Korean officials \"expressed regret\" that the Vietnamese woman was charged, the prime minister avoided the topic. \"This is an issue of the law. We also care about protecting the rights of our citizens, but both countries will discuss this specifically at a later time, not during this period,\" he said.
